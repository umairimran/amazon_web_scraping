"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,"I just received this case and do not yet know how it will hold up, but so far it fits my phone perfectly and has a far stronger magnet than I expected.

For my current phone, I‚Äôve been using clear cases, and this is the fourth one I‚Äôve bought. One was from Apple and two were reputable name-brand cases purchased from a big electronics retailer. Eventually, they all failed (cracked, came apart, yellowed, etc.), as I expect this one will, but at 1/3 the price of the other cases, this one won‚Äôt make me as mad about having to replace it."

This case has solid protection, a metal ring for MagSafe attachments, and a warranty that allows for 100% satisfaction.

It attached to the MagSafe car mount with enough strength to avoid falling off while driving through Michigan's pot hole filled streets but is easily lifted off when detaching. I‚Äôve actually pulled an inferior mount. But the case is nice and I would buy again."

"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,"I recently purchased this clear phone case with a tempered glass screen protector, lens protectors, and MagSafe compatibility, and overall, for my wife and we are quite pleased with it. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of what we've experienced so far:

Pros:

Comprehensive Protection: The inclusion of a tempered glass screen protector and lens protectors alongside the clear case is a huge plus. It feels reassuring to have a complete set of protection for my phone. The screen protector is particularly impressive; it's clear, responsive, and doesn't affect the touch sensitivity of my screen.

MagSafe Compatibility: The built-in MagSafe ring works seamlessly with my MagSafe charger and accessories. The alignment is spot-on, and charging is both efficient and secure. This feature was a key selling point for me, and it definitely lives up to the hype.

Clear and Sleek Design: The case itself is crystal clear and showcases the design of my phone without adding much bulk. The clarity of the case has not diminished over time, and it resists yellowing, which is always a concern with clear cases.

Cons:

Edge Protection: While the case provides decent coverage, the edges feel a bit more exposed compared to other cases I‚Äôve used. It‚Äôs not a deal-breaker, but I‚Äôd prefer slightly more cushion around the corners for added peace of mind against drops.

Lens Protectors Fit: The lens protectors are a good idea, but they can be a bit tricky to apply perfectly. I found myself spending a little extra time ensuring they were aligned correctly. Once in place, they do their job well, but a better application guide or pre-aligned design could improve this aspect.

Overall: This package offers excellent value with its all-in-one approach to phone protection and MagSafe compatibility. The minor issues with edge protection and lens protector application are outweighed by the benefits of having a clear, functional, and stylish case. I‚Äôd definitely recommend it for anyone looking to keep their phone safe while enjoying the benefits of MagSafe technology."
"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,"I ordered this item for my iPhone 15 pro max, which included a case, screen cover and camera lens protectors. The case is flexible and transparent. It is not slippery like some cases so you don‚Äôt have to worry about it sliding off the dashboard of a vehicle or other surface. The case and lens covers were very easy to install. The screen cover is something I always have issues with installing and this one was no different. I ended up having a few bubbles but this was not due to the quality of the product, likely just dust that floated onto my screen. If I would recommend one thing it would to be to include an install assist device for the screen. However this would likely increase the price. Overall it appears to be a great product and an excellent value compared to similar products. In addition I received quick response and resolution to a question I sent to the company. There was an issue with the QR code included not scanning. Janet from the ESR team immediately responded with a solution. So customer service appears to be excellent."
"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,"I love this case! I recently bought the magnetic charger and the previous case wasn‚Äôt compatible with that so I desperately needed a new one. The magnetic connection with the case on is equivalent to when there is no case, if not better (I mean seriously the charger does not move at all). The case seems to be really high quality and protective. My main concerns when I bought this were: 1. If the quality of the product was cheap and 2. If the magsafe component was reliable. Both concerns were kicked to the group because this case is amazing quality and magsafe component works extremely well. I am super satisfied. I purchased the all clear case for reference."
"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,"I purchased this phone case because I needed a MagSafe compatible case so that I could use a magnet pop socket! The ‚ÄúMagSafe‚Äù case I had previously mostly blocked the magnets from working on my charger. This case is wonderful! My magnets work super well, and the case fit my iPhone 13 Pro perfectly! I attached my new magnetic pop socket and it holds super well.
I love the clear design so that I can see the color of my phone through the case. My package came quickly!"
"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,"I have used two other clear case options before on my iPhone 13, the apple clear case, and the otterbox symmetry clear case. This case is certainly more plyable and less rigid than those other two options, especially the apple one, but I assume that this is a good thing especially with the cushioning material on the corners of the case. I haven't had any major drops with this case on but my phone has survived the ones that I have with no problem. This is also significantly cheaper than those cases I mentioned and I don't feel they provided any level of protection that is better enough to warrant the price difference. One other thing of note is the magsafe magnet on this phone is super strong. I got a magsafe wallet and when I put it on my apple clear case with an iphone 13 it doesn't grab strongly and will budge around, on this case, the wallet doesn't feel like it's going anywhere."
"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,"If you're looking for a slim and lightweight MagSafe case for your iPhone 15 Pro, The ESR clear/black option should make you happy. This case looks great and fits my 15 Pro very well.

The black edges have a nice smooth feel, but I wish they were a little more ""grippy."" The built-in MagSafe magnets provide wireless charging compatibility, while the clear back shows off the titanium finish of your iPhone Pro.

I am a little concerned with the case's protective qualities. The slim appearance comes at the cost of less protection around the most critical areas. The raised lip around the screen could be more robust, and I'd like to see more cushion around the frame, but I guess that's to be expected at this price-point. The edge around the lenses seems to work very well.

If you're serious about better drop protection, you should look at dual-layer or more rugged options instead. For me, this seems good enough for my day-to-day usage. I have a bulkier case if I'm heading out on an adventure. It will be interesting to see how this case holds up over time."

"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,"I recently purchased the ESR for iPhone 15 Pro Max Case, and it has truly exceeded my expectations in every way. Here‚Äôs why I highly recommend it:

### Design and Compatibility
The case is designed specifically for the iPhone 15 Pro Max and fits like a glove. It‚Äôs compatible with MagSafe, making wireless charging a breeze. The precise cutouts ensure that all buttons and ports are easily accessible, which is a significant plus.

### Protection
One of the standout features is its military-grade protection. I‚Äôve accidentally dropped my phone a couple of times, and this case has absorbed the impact beautifully, keeping my phone in perfect condition. The raised edges around the screen and camera offer extra protection against scratches and drops.

### Aesthetics
The clear design of the case allows the elegant look of the iPhone 15 Pro Max to shine through while providing robust protection. The yellowing-resistant material keeps it looking new and clear over time, which is a common issue with other clear cases I‚Äôve used in the past.

### Grip and Comfort
The case has a nice, firm grip that feels secure in hand, reducing the chances of accidental drops. It‚Äôs slim and doesn‚Äôt add unnecessary bulk to the phone, making it comfortable to hold and use daily.

### Conclusion
In summary, the ESR case for the iPhone 15 Pro Max is a perfect blend of style, functionality, and protection. It‚Äôs a great investment to keep your phone safe and looking pristine. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a reliable and stylish case!"
"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,"I have an iPhone 14 Pro. Please see all three reviews below:
One month review: Very pleased with my new clear case. Time will tell if it yellows as some have reported, but it appears that those that reported as much were mostly pleased with customer service. I‚Äôll check back in a few months to update.

The edge surrounding the camera lenses is higher than the lenses themselves, but only slightly. Ideally I would like a bit more protection, but this is adequate for flat surfaces.

After wiping down with a microfiber cloth it does not appear to a fingerprint problem. I wipe it down often, as I have done with all of my phones over the years. The edges are not overly ‚Äúgrippy,‚Äù but not slippery and has an overall good feel.

The magnetic field is very plenty strong, and the buttons all work well.

Six months update:
No yellowing and grip seems to have improved. Not experiencing any finger print issues, but an occasional wipe across your t-shirt doesn‚Äôt hurt.

Thirty minutes ago while looking elsewhere, I tripped over an unexpected top concrete step with phone in hand. I fell hard forward, putting my hands out to break my fall. Unfortunately, I had my phone in my hand and it slapped down hard onto a concrete sidewalk! Fortunately for me it was professionally installed and fairly smooth as concrete goes. Fearing the worst, I turned my phone over and was shocked to see only three little dings on my tempered glass screen protector, and no apparent damage to the screen itself!

I will be sticking with this brand in the future!

One month later, seven months:
The edges of the case have started to yellow a good amount. I cannot overlook the fact that the timing of this is in line with my installation of a new magnetic charger / mount in my car. Installed in an air vent, it is now a good deal higher than before and exposed to a lot more direct sunlight than before.
When I reached out to the manufacturer, I received a prompt response offering to replace the case under the two year warranty, but they did recommend a black case to replace it, after pointing out the various issues that might cause yellowing, especially direct sunlight. Despite this, I opted to replacing it with another clear case. It has served me well and I like the look. The replacement has already been shipped and I am extremely pleased with the prompt response and solution by the customer service team. I don‚Äôt know for certain, but I doubt a second replacement would be at no cost. In the meantime I will have to rethink the positioning of my car mount."
"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,"well I guess as much as a standard black phonecase can be. The case isn't opaque black like anticipated, HOWEVER it is opaque black for all the visibly darker spots in the advertised photo. The rest of the case is similar to a dark window tint. I bought this because I have the blue iPhone 13 Pro and generally dont like brighter colors for my phone, so when I saw the transparency I was worried, but it actually looks really good regardless."
"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,"I was having trouble with my case when a bottom part broke off, so reached out to ESR for support and the representative I spoke to (Fanny) was amazing and very helpful and was able to help me out with it. Case is easy to take on and off if needed which is a plus. Magnetic part works with a phone wallet I bought to go along with this case. I like how the silicone exterior provides grip when I have the phone in a large hoodie pocket so it doesn‚Äôt fall off. It is very sleek and doesn‚Äôt make the phone gigantic which is great."
"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,"Purchased this as a gift. Receiver used it for a few weeks with a multitude of chargers, but unfortunately none of them would work. Contacted ESR at their contact information provided through Amazon when I used that option from my previous orders.

I emailed over a holiday weekend, so I was expecting to wait until Tuesday for a reply, but got an email before 9:00AM Monday morning. I was given options for how I would like to solve my problem in that first email, which I appreciated very much. No one likes to go round and round with multiple emails with tech support before you can finally have your issue resolved. First email to select resolution option, second email resolution completed. üëçüèª

While the phone case, unfortunately did not work for me (and the recipient) I would not hesitate to try another product from ESR based on their customer service alone. I wish others would offer such easy customer service!"
"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,Hands down the best case I have ever owned. It looks thin but it protects your phone extremely well. I have dropped my phone multiple times on different job sites and there was no damage to the case or my phone. I was extremely surprised. My phone fell out of my truck going around 40mph and it just bounced. When I went to retire my phone I was fearing the worst. My phone was 100% operational and intact. The only damage sustained was some scuffs to the edges of the case. The mag safe works great as well and has strong magnets. I would 10 out of 10 recommend purchasing this case.
"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,"I love this case. I got it because my old clear one was yellowing and I wanted to try magsafe charging. I love how this feels in my hand - it's very soft like brushed powder. I haven't dropped my phone from a significant height yet, so I'm not sure how well it absorbs the shock, but I'll update if that happens. It seems to do well with smaller drops, tho."
"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,"Upon purchase, ESRgear expressed their commitment to me as a customer and said if anything is not up to par, contact them. This impressed me. So when the plastic grip nut cracked, I contacted ESR. Almost immediately they contacted me. I sent a picture and the new part was on the way.
My techie son told me this was the BEST charger. He was right. You step in the car and immediately attach it to magnetic secure base. No separate wires to mess with.
The little fan removes the concern about debilitating temperatures here in the Texas heat. I love this charger and this company. They actually put flesh on the saying, ‚ÄúWe care.‚Äù"
"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,"I love this case. So comfortable when holding, non-slip grip. Best of all, side buttons (on/off, volume, etc) are easily accessible. The ability to use the side buttons is very important to me. I had another brand that the side buttons were so difficult to access that I often took the case off. I have since thrown that case in the trash in lieu of this superior brand/design."
"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,"Purchased the case for my iPhone 15 Plus. It‚Äôs durable, feels comfortable while in use, and isn‚Äôt slippery. I am able to charge my phone with the case on without issues. I‚Äôve had it for about a week already and there‚Äôs no scratches when it‚Äôs in my backpack, purse, or pockets with my keys. It‚Äôs easy to wipe prints and/or smudges no problem. I am satisfied with its functionality and recommend this case."

The sides are better to grab with this cover because it combines 2 materials. The clear material is hard and sides have a soft skin-like feel. The dark blue creates a nice look against the clear, which shows white metallic for my iphone. The clear material is high quality. I was impressed and now I love my 15 pro Max even more!!"
"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,"I mainly got this case because I didn‚Äôt want to pay for the price of name brand stuff. This is perfect and the value is lovely. It‚Äôs protected my phone for almost a year now and hasn‚Äôt taken any damage to it, or any discoloration. It‚Äôs super easy to take off to clean, it‚Äôs the perfect size, and the color came exactly how it looked in the pictures (I got black) definitely recommend to anyone reading this, and I‚Äôve recommended it to friends also."
"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,"Absolutely amazed with this purchase and buying another right after this review. Set my brand new iPhone on my suburban tire (knowing that was a terrible decision) left, forgot about it backed up and CRUNCH. I completely ran over the whole thing with a SUBURBAN and my phone is absolutely unharmed. My mind is blown and I‚Äôm soooo thankful for this product!!!! Like I said headed to buy another!"
"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,"The case itself is really nice and has so far taken several drops without any damage. One small issue is that one day I noticed the small magnetic stripe was sticking up when I took my phone out to clean it. Then I saw a bit of the magnet was broken and sticking out. Upon asking the customer service if that little bit of the magnet missing could be a problem, they sent a new case right away. It‚Äôs the little things sometimes that make a big difference in order to keep customers."

This one came up in the top 5 on almost all of the website lists I checked. One site even checked the actual magnet strength of each case tested. This ESR for iPhone 14 Pro MagSafe Case was the 3rd or 4th strongest.

So why did I go with this ESR for iPhone 14 Pro Case, Compatible with MagSafe instead of the stronger ones? Price. I cannot justify spending $60 or more on a phone case. This one cost less than $20.

My MagSafe wallet sticks so well to this case, I can't even shake the phone off while the wallet is open. Yes, part of that is the strength of the magnets on the case itself, but even my MagSafe charger holds tight.

The case has a raised lip around the screen to protect it when you place the phone face down. There is also a raised lip around the camera lenses. The buttons are very responsive, and the charging port is easily accessible if you need to use it. There are also other cut outs for the speakers .

Also, the corners are extra thick (padded). This is supposed to help protect your phone if you drop it, but the shape also helps you keep hold of your phone. It rests easily in your hand.

I think I just found my new favorite brand of MagSafe case. Let's face it, I will have to get a new phone eventually. Just not yet. ESR makes a MagSafe case for the new ones as well.

This ESR for iPhone 14 Pro Case, Compatible with MagSafe is the best MagSafe case for the price. Bar None!"
"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,"I love this phone case. I don‚Äôt know why but suddenly I just got on a phone dropping spree for some reason.. was wearing a lot of shorts with what can barely be described as a pocket I guess. Anyways I‚Äôve dropped this in concrete many times and there is not a single scratch on this phone case. I just wipe away the dust expecting some kind of damage, nothing. Looks nice too, sleek, not very grippy but still pretty easy to hold. Nothing bad I can really say about it."
"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,"I‚Äôve spent two weeks with this case so far and it‚Äôs already helped the phone survive a drop on tile and one on asphalt. I‚Äôll update a bit later into the case‚Äôs lifetime but I‚Äôm honestly already pretty impressed. It‚Äôs not bulky at all, and it‚Äôs machined well; all the features on the case are sized and spaced appropriately for an iPhone (Pro 14, in my case). The clear material is slightly tacky, compared with the Apple brand, which helps grip in hand without being, like, sticky. The raised lip around the screen protects well and the slight bumpered corners help absorb impact from tumbles without adding the kind of bulk that affects its fit in pockets, which is really nice (the old Ballistic brand cases had the best corner protection but it cost me being able to fit the phone in places I wish I could have, sadly‚Äîthis seems like a good tradeoff so far).

The shape of the camera guard also diffuses the flashlight glow a bit so I can get just a little, indirect light from it when it‚Äôs face down on a surface, which is often perfect and one of the selling points of the clear Apple case I had before. I don‚Äôt think this will work with the opaque cases. Hopefully this material is resistant to the yellowing/browning that happened to the Apple case (barely lasted a year).

As of right now I‚Äôd say get this if you want a well-built, basic case at a decent price that stands up to realistic drops and accidents. Good chance I‚Äôll still say that by time this one retires, too."
"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,"This is the second case I bought from this company. When my first one finally cracked, I bought a different one with the magnetic option as I use a pop socket wallet. The replacement failed too many times from day one. I ordered a new one like my old and love how secure the magnet is. The case is flexible, but strong, doesn‚Äôt discolor, and is easily removed for cleaning."
"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,"I bought this for my lovely wife so she could start using MagSafe accessories, like a car mount, charger, etc. She wanted a strong magnet, and the ability to still see the pretty yellow color she chose. This guy fit the bill, and she has been very pleased. Super great magnet, snaps on to everything MagSafe, and holds without worry. The case itself is nice, buttons click well, and best of all, my wife is happy with it. Would recommend, especially at the price point. I‚Äôve paid much more, for much worse."
"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,"I traded my iPhone 12 Pro Max for a 15 Pro Max this weekend. I'd kept the 12 in a black Otterbox case which protected the phone but was bulky and starting to come apart around the edges. It was also difficult to remove the phone and put it back in. It also sometimes didn't make good contact with the mag chargers.

For the 15, I got this clear case from ESR. Easy to install and remove. Works perfectly with my mag mount in the car and my mag charger at home. It's a little smaller than the Otter so it's easier to fit into the mount on my ebike, too. Most importantly, it protects the phone and has a nice edge to protect the camera lenses. Finally, all the slots for buttons on the phone match up perfectly."

My phone was dropped going 30 mph from a 4 wheeler and the case totally protected the phone. However, the lens covers cracked within about a week of having the case without having any drops. I reached out to customer service and they issued a full replacement immediately. I will absolutely recommend this brand to friends and family!"
"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,"This has been a phenomenal case. I drop my phone probably every day -- on hardwood floors, on granite countertops, and of course, on the pavement when I get out of the car. Not once did my phone get dinged. The case shows no signs of wear, save for the slight yellowing that has occurred. This is to be expected -- no TPU case is truly yellow-proof. One of the best things about this case is the extra MagSafe-compatible magnet ring built into it. I use the MagSafe connection not only for charging, but also for quickly mounting my phone to MagSafe-compatible phone stands, tripods, and magnetic ceiling mounts (for use as an extra camera at church). Never have I worried about my phone falling off of a mount. This is truly the best phone case I have ever used."

I reached out to their customer service and they instantly sent me a new one at no cost! The product is also amazing, I can tell the product is high quality and it was easy to install. The size was perfect, it fit just right. Will update later if needed!"
"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,"I‚Äôve had the case for eight months, and I‚Äôve been very happy with it. It fits my phone perfectly, is protective without being bulky, feels great to hold, and it allows the magnet to work when needed.

For the first six months, the case looked great, allowing the phone to be clearly seen. However, I then started noticing the discoloration and yellowing common to clear cases, and now it just looks kind of dirty and gross even though it‚Äôs clean.

If I were happy to get a good six months out of the case for this price, I‚Äôd be satisfied, but I prefer getting more use. Still earned four stars from me because I really did like it."
"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,I like the look and feel in my hand of the case. Cannot beat the price on this protective case. So clear to show off the actual color of my iPhone. The MagSafe charging connection could be a bit better but so far no yellowing of the plastic like other more expensive brands have disappointed.
"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,I really do like the phone case and its look and feel. Not to slippery with the gripping edges but smooth on the face so it slides in your pocket easily. It feels better in hand than my otterbox slim I had before and the MagSafe magnet is very strong. Would buy it again!
"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,"I bought this case for 2 reasons. 1. Protection 2. Mag Safe, and so far, I have gotten both of those things. I love the design of the Iphone case and the corners made to help with impact on the floor. The Mag Safe magnet is far superior to any of the ones I have ever seen. The camera protection is perfect and helps me not have to buy camera protection. The case also includes one of those string attachment things for those who like to attach accessories to their devices. I truly recommend this product to everyone in the market."

"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,"I've purchased clear, plastic cases before and didn't have a great time with them, so I bought this with some doubts in mind.
However, as soon as I snapped it onto my iPhone 13 Pro Max, I knew this was a great purchase. Some important things I noticed immedately:
- I care a lot about how strong the MagSafe is, because I use a lot of Mag accessories. This magnet is STRONG. Stronger than the Apple Silicone case I am changing from. This was a huge plus for me.
The magnet is so strong, that my accessories don't move while attached, which is an issue I had with an otterbox because the material was smooth like this plastic case. But this issue doesn't exist on this ESR phone case.
- The lips around the front of the phone come up high enough where I think the screen will be protected in case of a fall. I do not use a screen protector.
- there is extra padding on each of the corners. Nice touch.

Since this is my first day with the case, I have no idea if one day in the future this clear plastic case will become ""sunburnt"" and turn yellow. That is usually the case with clear cases but we'll see - I am pretty happy with this quality and price so far."

Will definitely re-purchase!"

The cover is pliable which keeps the phone from damage when dropped. I can attest to this with assurance because I proceeded to drop it unintentionally, shortly after putting on this amazing case. I‚Äôm notorious for dropping my phone! üôÑ I love that the case is transparent because I can hold my two specials pressed flowers in it as a constant reminder of my memories. Highly recommend this iPhone case!!"
"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,"We tried several brands and types of casss for our new 15 Pro phones and found the ESR cases to be the best combination of protection and feel/looks. MagSafe works perfectly and the case doesn‚Äôt interfere with things like wireless charging in our cars. Good feel, soft yet still grippy enough to not be slippery, but not so grippy it rips rips your pocket inside out when putting in/taking out. Colors are true as shown and stylish. Case is thin but still offers good protection from drops. Customer service has been stellar, we had a minor issue with one of our cases and customer service was super fast to resolve, on a weekend no less, don‚Äôt see that much anymore. Would recommend these cases for sure!"

Very strong and i don't worry about finger ring detaching from case easily when dropping phone from sofa to carpet like with other more expensive cases i purchased at Apple store.

"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,"I purchased this blue clear case for my yellow iPhone 14 to replace my old one. I love that the edges of the case are colored but the back is clear so I can see my pretty yellow phone! Hopefully this will help with discoloration that all clear cases seem to suffer from (that dingy yucky brown/ yellow color). My last case was so slippery and I kept dropping it. This case seems to provide a nice grip and I‚Äôve yet to lose hold of it. The magnetic circle (MagSafe) is very strong! It keeps my pop socket firmly attached and I don‚Äôt have any worry at all that it will fall off or get torn off by accident. I was hoping I could find a case with yellow edges that would match my phone exactly, but no one seems to offer that color. The blue goes well with yellow and matches my Harry Potter owl pop socket so it works great! Sorry about the lighting in the photos, but hopefully you‚Äôll get the idea if you have a yellow phone and are looking for something that will match and not look weird. Highly recommend!"

However, my phone fell out of my front pocket when I was trying to sit down and the inside of the case cracked near the camera. It barely fell 1 foot, so I'm not sure how well this case is going to hold up. I reached out to customer service and they responded promptly and were willing to send me a new one, which is awesome! I will still use the case, I just hope that one case was a faulty one and I have better luck with the new one. I do recommend buying from them because they know how to treat their customers well! Bumping down to 4 stars just because of the questionable durability."

"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,"This case has broken the fall of an iPhone 15 Pro onto concrete or gravel too many times to count. The screen protector broke during one of those falls, but the iPhone itself has held up through each fall a-okay.

The only thing subtracting a star is how the appearance holds up over time. It started a brilliant and shining phone case, making up for the sides of the iPhone no longer being glossy like the 13 pro. Now, the case is dulling and yellow on the sides. It detracts from the look of the phone. It happened even though I clean my phone and case regularly. If the anti-yellowing held up as well on the sides as it held up on the back, this would be a five star case.

I submitted a warranty claim or support ticket about the yellowing case. Exposure to water, skincare products, and sunlight can cause yellowing. ESR support offered the same case but the clear black color as a replacement. I will likely be updating the review once I have used the clear black case

Overall, the case has good protection and doesn‚Äôt have thin easily-breakable plastic around the charging port and speakers."

It is a good product. It is sleek and looks nice and performs its function. I dropped the phone two or three times from a few feet above ground and the phone suffered no damage. The one caveat is that the surface is very grippy and will pull things out of your pocket it is touching. For example, I lost a metro card and some cash because the case gripped onto them when I pulled my phone out of my pocket and I didn‚Äôt realize it. You have to beware and take appropriate measures to prevent this from happening because it happened on more than the two occasions where I actually lost something important. I just didn‚Äôt happen to notice those times. It‚Äôs not really a fault of the case so it‚Äôs still five stars, but something to beware of."

However, my small hands barely wrap around the iPhone 15 Pro Max and this soft, silky case on all sides made it too slippery for me to hold and handle. Not a failing or flaw, only a limitation for some."

I am impressed with how well it works with all my MagSafe accessories. I can't rate it for phone protection yet as I haven't dropped the phone since I started using the case.

But this version has a nice silicone band around the outside that makes it really easy to hang on to. The case seems really well made and the magnet is really strong.

I contacted customer support, and they responded promptly (within about 36 hours), and they immediately offered to send a replacement.

My phone dropped a couple of times onto the concrete floor of my garage and it literally just bounced with no damage to the case or phone.
What impressed me most however was the excellent customer service I received when I wrote to ESR about the discoloration of my case. They were very understanding and accommodating.

for iPhone 15 Case Clear - 5-in-1 Camera Lens and Glass Screen Protector,9,Just installed the new case on my iPhone. It fits well and seems secure. The glass front protector is easy to install and the installation tool makes it a breeze to get it straight and accurate to place on the screen. The cover for the camera lens came off after installing. Found it and cleaned it up and reinstalled it. Will see how it goes. Could live without it as I never had one on my previous phone. But it is a nice feature. Probably did not get it clean before application. Overall the kit is great. Would recommend it.

for iPhone 15 Case Clear - 5-in-1 Camera Lens and Glass Screen Protector,9,"My son got this for his new phone. He dropped it and the corner of the screen cracked. Another time he sat it down a little too hard and the screen protector cracked. This case is for looks only, do not recommend if you're trying to keep your phone in tact. No shock absorption at all."
for iPhone 15 Case Clear - 5-in-1 Camera Lens and Glass Screen Protector,9,"My biggest issue with this case is that, while the edges are raised (on the back) enough to prevent the camera lenses from causing your phone to wobble if flat on a table, it also makes it awkward to put into your pocket. It's not a smooth back and it's therefore not as slim as I'd like it to be. But it's definitely thick enough to provide good protection against drops, and it also does come with a hard cover for the camera lenses. Plenty of polishing and cleaning pads, and I must say that this is one of the best options for applying the screen protector... Place the frame down over the top of your phone, pull the tab, press out any air pockets, and you're good to go! Very easy to also gently peel back just the corner if there's a tiny ""dot"" of air or dust, and still stick perfectly. I literally can't even see anything except the very side edges, and once in a case, you can't even see the top or bottom edges of the screen protector. EXCELLENT! It's also great that it comes with 2, so you can keep one for later or just use it on another phone. So... Totally happy with the screen protector and application method; not loving the raised edges on the back of the case; and personally not using the camera lense covers (I prefer nothing over them so I'm sure to completely avoid unwanted reflections or haze effects). Over all, 4 out of 5 stars."
for iPhone 15 Case Clear - 5-in-1 Camera Lens and Glass Screen Protector,9,"Screen protectors for the new iPhone 15 Pro Max have been haphazard with most not properly fitting. They either cover up part of the display, have an awkward black trim that cuts into the display (to hide how poorly they align with the phone), or don't come with an installation frame.

I picked up this pack because of the two screen protectors with installer guide. I have a case for my iPhone 15 Pro Max and had no intentions of using this one because it isn't MagSafe. So, I will just get this out of the way: the case is hot garbage. It doesn't have MagSafe, it comes with thin plastic sheets on the back and front of the case that are difficult to remove, and there are mold injection circles on the back. Throw the case out and let it sit in a landfill for 1000 years, that's all it's good for.

The screen protectors aren't bad. The installer frame came with one installed and it was easy to put on my phone. It lines up well and doesn't cover the display. The second one was difficult to install in the frame and fell out while I was putting it on my other iPhone 15 Pro Max. Still, it was easy enough to fix.

These will do until different companies release better screen protectors that properly fit the iPhone 15 Pro Max's display."
for iPhone 15 Case Clear - 5-in-1 Camera Lens and Glass Screen Protector,9,This is a very nice kit and the screen protectors are easy to install with the frame tool. You get everything you need to protect your phone. The screen protectors do not cover the entire screen but leave a small area at the edge to allow for cases to fit without pushing on the screen protector. These fit my 15 Pro Max great. They perform as expected so I give them 4 stars.
for iPhone 15 Case Clear - 5-in-1 Camera Lens and Glass Screen Protector,9,"I was drawn to the method for screen protector installation, and it did not disappoint. The protector is exactly aligned, and the screen is dust free. It doesn‚Äôt have any cutouts, so it matches the phone display.

The edges are barely rounded, so running your fingers across isn‚Äôt a problem, but it‚Äôs not a smooth transition from phone to screen. In a case it doesn‚Äôt matter.

The edges of the protector are exactly aligned with the viewable display area, rather than overlapping like most protectors. It makes the border between the protector and the glass stand out as little more, and the border around the entire protector is larger than other protectors I‚Äôve tried with this phone.

After trying a few, I went back to this one for the screen protection.

It doesn‚Äôt appear to interfere with Face ID or the camera.

The case is ok, and it has the right cutouts and buttons, and includes a spot for a wristband or charm loop. It doesn‚Äôt have magnets so it doesn‚Äôt hold to magnetic mounts as well as cases which do have magnets. However, the back is perfectly clear so if you don‚Äôt like the MagSafe look, this case shows off the back of your phone very well.

I chose to use a different case as I use a lot of magnetic mounts.

The camera protection is nice and easy to install. I was impressed with how small the border is, and had no problem with it interfering with the other case design I use.

Overall this is a good kit, even if you don‚Äôt use one or two of its parts."
for iPhone 15 Case Clear - 5-in-1 Camera Lens and Glass Screen Protector,9,"Update: My very new iPhone 15 Pro popped off a bike handlebar holder and tumbled to the pavement. Its case held. The Masetech screen protector was unscathed but the lens protector area was not so lucky. It did its job and prevented anything from happening to the 3 camera lenses. For that I give the highest review possible!!

Prior review: An uncomplicated pack of protectors along with a basic case if you prefer one without the magsafe ring. The screen protector is nearly imperceptible when mounted and the frame tool kept it precisely aligned. As far as fit, the lens protectors match properly -- but I have not tested it enough to say whether there are any noticeable optical issues when used with angular light sources encountered.
The screen protectors were placed on a 'virgin' phone where the factory shield was only removed seconds before installation, so it was easy to avoid potential dust related bubbles. I did encounter what you might term nanoscale bubbles that needed to be 'massaged' out due to very tiny amounts of air that somehow made it under the protective film. While it took only a small amount of effort and careful pressure, it was resolved and the protector then looked immaculate. Getting a case is a bonus if you only need the protective covers from this particular kit."
for iPhone 15 Case Clear - 5-in-1 Camera Lens and Glass Screen Protector,9,The screen protector was super easy to install and I love that the cameras are protected. I haven't had any problems with it so far. The case is sturdy and comfortable to use.

It came with an extra protector as well for additional use. I would highly recommend!
for iPhone 15 Case Clear - 5-in-1 Camera Lens and Glass Screen Protector,9,"Got this to protect my new iPhone 15 Pro from scratches and dings. Although titanium is on the tougher and more durable side, it can aesthetically get scratched up. The transparent case was easy to slip on, and it only took seconds. The screen protector is tempered glass, and no bubbles were left on the screen after installation. There is a camera lens protector, which is a plus. Picture quality is not negatively impacted by it. Overall, this is a pretty solid set for anyone who just upgraded or got the iPhone 15 Pro (2023). Worth."
for iPhone 15 Case Clear - 5-in-1 Camera Lens and Glass Screen Protector,9,"I was surprised to see that this case and screen protector was available before the iPhone 15 Pro was officially released, so I decided to give it a try and see how it would work against all the other screen protector cases that are out there. It arrived before the official release of the 15 Pro Max, so it was waiting for the phones arrival. Once the phone arrived, it went from delivery box, straight into this case & screen protector kit.

If I was to summarize how easy it was to apply, and how well it protects the phone, all I can say is wow! It does a great job on both of these. Let me start with what's included in the box. It comes with two screen protectors, it comes with a screen applicator guide tool, a camera protector kit, and of course - it comes with a case protector with corner side airbags.

When it comes to applying the screen protector, you're able to easily slide it into the applicator tool. Just make sure that it's inserted correctly, so when you pull on the tab, it sticky side of the screen protector applies downward, and easily applies onto the iPhone display. Additionally, once applied - it has about a three-quarter to a 1 mm gap next to the edges. This is ok, because the case protector is actually elevated and raised a little. I haven't noticed any interactions after applying the screen protector, and the gap of the case, and I've seen this on numerous other screen protectors in the past. So it doesn't really have much of an impact on its functionality or its protection.

Once you line it up, the display protector actually lines up perfectly, and it's very symmetrical around the entire phones display. The application tool also fits over the iPhone 15 Pro Max as intended, almost as if it was perfectly suited for it. Just make sure that you follow the instructions on how to peel the tab, and also how to squeeze, any remaining pockets of air. Just make sure that when you start the screen protector bonding process, you start from the middle, so it applies onto the display from the middle outward to the edges of the screen. It will help in reducing the number of bubbles, and squeezing them out later as well. Do your best in order to make sure that the screen is also as clean as possible before applying, with no dust particles on it - so when you peel the tab back, you don't have any dust particles stuck underneath the display. It comes with stickers, so you can use them to remove any dust particles from the screen before hand. Use them even if you don‚Äôt see any dust particles, it‚Äôs better to use them even if you don‚Äôt see any, so that later you don‚Äôt find any stuck between the display/protecter thereafter. Once the protector is applied, that‚Äôs it - there‚Äôs no taking it off unless your discarding it.

It also comes with a protective cover cap for the tri-lens camera module. It actually fits really well, but it does leave a few bubbles underneath it. Not directly over the camera lens, but on the spaces between the cameras. I did my best to try to make it stick and apply permanently with no bubbles, but wasn't able to get it without any bubble residue. It doesn't really have an impact on the actual functionality of the camera, or the photos it takes, but I thought that may be the bubbles might go away after a week of use, but they still remain. The good thing about this camera protector, is that it actually fits into the phone protector case like a glove. It doesn't have any issues in regards to sliding into place correctly. It actually fits incredibly well.

When it comes to the case, just make sure that you peel off the protector plastic residue, which you can see in a few photos I provided from both the inside and outer side of the protector case. The protector cases is then nice and clear, and it looks beautifully once your iPhone is inserted inside of it. The iPhone also fits snugly inside the case, and the protector case allows the iPhones design and beauty shines through. The best part about this case that I haven't seen on many other case protectors out there, is the airbags on the corners. These airbags are incredibly important, because when you drop your phone and if it lands on the corner, it helps protect the phone and display glass. I've noticed this on other phone cases, and have even tested it by dropping it on its corner from a waist high height. You can even hear a pop every once in a while, where it's the airbag, taking the impact, with the screen and glass back of the phone being protected. I don‚Äôt recommend others out there to just drop and test this on their own, but if that day ever came where it falls accidentally, it will help protect the phone. When you hear this pop, it does sound scary, but it's actually the airbag doing its job. It also has about a half a millimeter to 1 mm raise lip on the display and backside, so that way when you put the phone on its back or screen face down, it actually lifts the phone up just enough, so that it doesn't scratch the display or back. I love this lip design, and helps reduce the number of scratches onto the display or the back of the phone protector.

The cutout for the USB-C is also really good, and I haven't had any issues connecting third-party USB-C cords into it. The grill openings for the speakers and mic are also well positioned, and haven‚Äôt had any sound or users complaining of not being able to hear me.

So now, how well does the case work? After a week of use, I haven't noticed any bubbles appear on the screen protector, and haven't noticed any yellowing of the case so far. Yellowing is something that obviously happens over time, and it's hard to predict if that's going to happen to this one, but ‚Äì so far it's working out really well, and I haven't noticed any yellowing of the case so far. In regards to gathering scratches, it has one little minor nick that it gained over the past week, and I'm happy that I had the phone protector case on it, as I'm sure it protected the phone from this type of damage.

As for the applied screen protector, it doesn't impact any functionality of the screen, and I'm still able to perfectly interact with iOS through it. I've also played a few games, and haven't noticed any issues in regards to functionality. One fun fact, I also put a little drop of water on the screen protector, and it actually bubbled up and slid around easily. So in a way, you could kind of tell that it appears to have a minor oleophobic coating on it. This is great, and haven't noticed any impact in regards to light coming through it from the display.

Overall, after a solid week of use, the screen protector in case have been top-notch. It's easy to apply, protects not only the camera and the corners with the airbags, but it still shows through the beauty and design of the phone. It also comes with an additional screen, protector and camera protector mount, so in case, if it gets cracked or scratched really bad, you're able to easily replace it. The only outlier is if it will yellow overtime, but that's something that won't show or reveal itself until months of use.

In the end, I give this case, camera and screen protector five out of five stars. I would recommend this product for others to buy, and think it's great value for the price for the protection it provides your phone. This is a great gift, and if you plan on buying an iPhone, I recommend that you order this case & kit before your new iPhone arrives, so that it goes straight from box into this protector kit. I‚Äôm very happy with this protector case."

for iPhone 15 Case Clear - 5-in-1 Camera Lens and Glass Screen Protector,9,Just installed the new case on my iPhone. It fits well and seems secure. The glass front protector is easy to install and the installation tool makes it a breeze to get it straight and accurate to place on the screen. The cover for the camera lens came off after installing. Found it and cleaned it up and reinstalled it. Will see how it goes. Could live without it as I never had one on my previous phone. But it is a nice feature. Probably did not get it clean before application. Overall the kit is great. Would recommend it.

for iPhone 15 Case Clear - 5-in-1 Camera Lens and Glass Screen Protector,9,"My son got this for his new phone. He dropped it and the corner of the screen cracked. Another time he sat it down a little too hard and the screen protector cracked. This case is for looks only, do not recommend if you're trying to keep your phone in tact. No shock absorption at all."
for iPhone 15 Case Clear - 5-in-1 Camera Lens and Glass Screen Protector,9,"My biggest issue with this case is that, while the edges are raised (on the back) enough to prevent the camera lenses from causing your phone to wobble if flat on a table, it also makes it awkward to put into your pocket. It's not a smooth back and it's therefore not as slim as I'd like it to be. But it's definitely thick enough to provide good protection against drops, and it also does come with a hard cover for the camera lenses. Plenty of polishing and cleaning pads, and I must say that this is one of the best options for applying the screen protector... Place the frame down over the top of your phone, pull the tab, press out any air pockets, and you're good to go! Very easy to also gently peel back just the corner if there's a tiny ""dot"" of air or dust, and still stick perfectly. I literally can't even see anything except the very side edges, and once in a case, you can't even see the top or bottom edges of the screen protector. EXCELLENT! It's also great that it comes with 2, so you can keep one for later or just use it on another phone. So... Totally happy with the screen protector and application method; not loving the raised edges on the back of the case; and personally not using the camera lense covers (I prefer nothing over them so I'm sure to completely avoid unwanted reflections or haze effects). Over all, 4 out of 5 stars."
for iPhone 15 Case Clear - 5-in-1 Camera Lens and Glass Screen Protector,9,"Screen protectors for the new iPhone 15 Pro Max have been haphazard with most not properly fitting. They either cover up part of the display, have an awkward black trim that cuts into the display (to hide how poorly they align with the phone), or don't come with an installation frame.

I picked up this pack because of the two screen protectors with installer guide. I have a case for my iPhone 15 Pro Max and had no intentions of using this one because it isn't MagSafe. So, I will just get this out of the way: the case is hot garbage. It doesn't have MagSafe, it comes with thin plastic sheets on the back and front of the case that are difficult to remove, and there are mold injection circles on the back. Throw the case out and let it sit in a landfill for 1000 years, that's all it's good for.

The screen protectors aren't bad. The installer frame came with one installed and it was easy to put on my phone. It lines up well and doesn't cover the display. The second one was difficult to install in the frame and fell out while I was putting it on my other iPhone 15 Pro Max. Still, it was easy enough to fix.

These will do until different companies release better screen protectors that properly fit the iPhone 15 Pro Max's display."
for iPhone 15 Case Clear - 5-in-1 Camera Lens and Glass Screen Protector,9,This is a very nice kit and the screen protectors are easy to install with the frame tool. You get everything you need to protect your phone. The screen protectors do not cover the entire screen but leave a small area at the edge to allow for cases to fit without pushing on the screen protector. These fit my 15 Pro Max great. They perform as expected so I give them 4 stars.
for iPhone 15 Case Clear - 5-in-1 Camera Lens and Glass Screen Protector,9,"I was drawn to the method for screen protector installation, and it did not disappoint. The protector is exactly aligned, and the screen is dust free. It doesn‚Äôt have any cutouts, so it matches the phone display.

The edges are barely rounded, so running your fingers across isn‚Äôt a problem, but it‚Äôs not a smooth transition from phone to screen. In a case it doesn‚Äôt matter.

The edges of the protector are exactly aligned with the viewable display area, rather than overlapping like most protectors. It makes the border between the protector and the glass stand out as little more, and the border around the entire protector is larger than other protectors I‚Äôve tried with this phone.

After trying a few, I went back to this one for the screen protection.

It doesn‚Äôt appear to interfere with Face ID or the camera.

The case is ok, and it has the right cutouts and buttons, and includes a spot for a wristband or charm loop. It doesn‚Äôt have magnets so it doesn‚Äôt hold to magnetic mounts as well as cases which do have magnets. However, the back is perfectly clear so if you don‚Äôt like the MagSafe look, this case shows off the back of your phone very well.

I chose to use a different case as I use a lot of magnetic mounts.

The camera protection is nice and easy to install. I was impressed with how small the border is, and had no problem with it interfering with the other case design I use.

Overall this is a good kit, even if you don‚Äôt use one or two of its parts."
for iPhone 15 Case Clear - 5-in-1 Camera Lens and Glass Screen Protector,9,"Update: My very new iPhone 15 Pro popped off a bike handlebar holder and tumbled to the pavement. Its case held. The Masetech screen protector was unscathed but the lens protector area was not so lucky. It did its job and prevented anything from happening to the 3 camera lenses. For that I give the highest review possible!!

Prior review: An uncomplicated pack of protectors along with a basic case if you prefer one without the magsafe ring. The screen protector is nearly imperceptible when mounted and the frame tool kept it precisely aligned. As far as fit, the lens protectors match properly -- but I have not tested it enough to say whether there are any noticeable optical issues when used with angular light sources encountered.
The screen protectors were placed on a 'virgin' phone where the factory shield was only removed seconds before installation, so it was easy to avoid potential dust related bubbles. I did encounter what you might term nanoscale bubbles that needed to be 'massaged' out due to very tiny amounts of air that somehow made it under the protective film. While it took only a small amount of effort and careful pressure, it was resolved and the protector then looked immaculate. Getting a case is a bonus if you only need the protective covers from this particular kit."
for iPhone 15 Case Clear - 5-in-1 Camera Lens and Glass Screen Protector,9,The screen protector was super easy to install and I love that the cameras are protected. I haven't had any problems with it so far. The case is sturdy and comfortable to use.

for iPhone 15 Case Clear - 5-in-1 Camera Lens and Glass Screen Protector,9,"Super satisfied with this case.

Ooo I forgot to add that the auto alignment kit is super helpful to avoid mess-ups and headaches."

for iPhone 15 Case Clear - 5-in-1 Camera Lens and Glass Screen Protector,9,Great starter kit for you new iPhone. It came with everything you n need to protect my new phone and the installation was quick and easy. I love the addition of the screen protector border to assist with the alignment. It came with an extra protector as well for additional use. I would highly recommend!
for iPhone 15 Case Clear - 5-in-1 Camera Lens and Glass Screen Protector,9,"Got this to protect my new iPhone 15 Pro from scratches and dings. Although titanium is on the tougher and more durable side, it can aesthetically get scratched up. The transparent case was easy to slip on, and it only took seconds. The screen protector is tempered glass, and no bubbles were left on the screen after installation. There is a camera lens protector, which is a plus. Picture quality is not negatively impacted by it. Overall, this is a pretty solid set for anyone who just upgraded or got the iPhone 15 Pro (2023). Worth."
for iPhone 15 Case Clear - 5-in-1 Camera Lens and Glass Screen Protector,9,"I was surprised to see that this case and screen protector was available before the iPhone 15 Pro was officially released, so I decided to give it a try and see how it would work against all the other screen protector cases that are out there. It arrived before the official release of the 15 Pro Max, so it was waiting for the phones arrival. Once the phone arrived, it went from delivery box, straight into this case & screen protector kit.

If I was to summarize how easy it was to apply, and how well it protects the phone, all I can say is wow! It does a great job on both of these. Let me start with what's included in the box. It comes with two screen protectors, it comes with a screen applicator guide tool, a camera protector kit, and of course - it comes with a case protector with corner side airbags.

When it comes to applying the screen protector, you're able to easily slide it into the applicator tool. Just make sure that it's inserted correctly, so when you pull on the tab, it sticky side of the screen protector applies downward, and easily applies onto the iPhone display. Additionally, once applied - it has about a three-quarter to a 1 mm gap next to the edges. This is ok, because the case protector is actually elevated and raised a little. I haven't noticed any interactions after applying the screen protector, and the gap of the case, and I've seen this on numerous other screen protectors in the past. So it doesn't really have much of an impact on its functionality or its protection.

Once you line it up, the display protector actually lines up perfectly, and it's very symmetrical around the entire phones display. The application tool also fits over the iPhone 15 Pro Max as intended, almost as if it was perfectly suited for it. Just make sure that you follow the instructions on how to peel the tab, and also how to squeeze, any remaining pockets of air. Just make sure that when you start the screen protector bonding process, you start from the middle, so it applies onto the display from the middle outward to the edges of the screen. It will help in reducing the number of bubbles, and squeezing them out later as well. Do your best in order to make sure that the screen is also as clean as possible before applying, with no dust particles on it - so when you peel the tab back, you don't have any dust particles stuck underneath the display. It comes with stickers, so you can use them to remove any dust particles from the screen before hand. Use them even if you don‚Äôt see any dust particles, it‚Äôs better to use them even if you don‚Äôt see any, so that later you don‚Äôt find any stuck between the display/protecter thereafter. Once the protector is applied, that‚Äôs it - there‚Äôs no taking it off unless your discarding it.

It also comes with a protective cover cap for the tri-lens camera module. It actually fits really well, but it does leave a few bubbles underneath it. Not directly over the camera lens, but on the spaces between the cameras. I did my best to try to make it stick and apply permanently with no bubbles, but wasn't able to get it without any bubble residue. It doesn't really have an impact on the actual functionality of the camera, or the photos it takes, but I thought that may be the bubbles might go away after a week of use, but they still remain. The good thing about this camera protector, is that it actually fits into the phone protector case like a glove. It doesn't have any issues in regards to sliding into place correctly. It actually fits incredibly well.

When it comes to the case, just make sure that you peel off the protector plastic residue, which you can see in a few photos I provided from both the inside and outer side of the protector case. The protector cases is then nice and clear, and it looks beautifully once your iPhone is inserted inside of it. The iPhone also fits snugly inside the case, and the protector case allows the iPhones design and beauty shines through. The best part about this case that I haven't seen on many other case protectors out there, is the airbags on the corners. These airbags are incredibly important, because when you drop your phone and if it lands on the corner, it helps protect the phone and display glass. I've noticed this on other phone cases, and have even tested it by dropping it on its corner from a waist high height. You can even hear a pop every once in a while, where it's the airbag, taking the impact, with the screen and glass back of the phone being protected. I don‚Äôt recommend others out there to just drop and test this on their own, but if that day ever came where it falls accidentally, it will help protect the phone. When you hear this pop, it does sound scary, but it's actually the airbag doing its job. It also has about a half a millimeter to 1 mm raise lip on the display and backside, so that way when you put the phone on its back or screen face down, it actually lifts the phone up just enough, so that it doesn't scratch the display or back. I love this lip design, and helps reduce the number of scratches onto the display or the back of the phone protector.

The cutout for the USB-C is also really good, and I haven't had any issues connecting third-party USB-C cords into it. The grill openings for the speakers and mic are also well positioned, and haven‚Äôt had any sound or users complaining of not being able to hear me.

So now, how well does the case work? After a week of use, I haven't noticed any bubbles appear on the screen protector, and haven't noticed any yellowing of the case so far. Yellowing is something that obviously happens over time, and it's hard to predict if that's going to happen to this one, but ‚Äì so far it's working out really well, and I haven't noticed any yellowing of the case so far. In regards to gathering scratches, it has one little minor nick that it gained over the past week, and I'm happy that I had the phone protector case on it, as I'm sure it protected the phone from this type of damage.

As for the applied screen protector, it doesn't impact any functionality of the screen, and I'm still able to perfectly interact with iOS through it. I've also played a few games, and haven't noticed any issues in regards to functionality. One fun fact, I also put a little drop of water on the screen protector, and it actually bubbled up and slid around easily. So in a way, you could kind of tell that it appears to have a minor oleophobic coating on it. This is great, and haven't noticed any impact in regards to light coming through it from the display.

Overall, after a solid week of use, the screen protector in case have been top-notch. It's easy to apply, protects not only the camera and the corners with the airbags, but it still shows through the beauty and design of the phone. It also comes with an additional screen, protector and camera protector mount, so in case, if it gets cracked or scratched really bad, you're able to easily replace it. The only outlier is if it will yellow overtime, but that's something that won't show or reveal itself until months of use.

In the end, I give this case, camera and screen protector five out of five stars. I would recommend this product for others to buy, and think it's great value for the price for the protection it provides your phone. This is a great gift, and if you plan on buying an iPhone, I recommend that you order this case & kit before your new iPhone arrives, so that it goes straight from box into this protector kit. I‚Äôm very happy with this protector case."

for iPhone 15 Case Clear - 5-in-1 Camera Lens and Glass Screen Protector,9,Just installed the new case on my iPhone. It fits well and seems secure. The glass front protector is easy to install and the installation tool makes it a breeze to get it straight and accurate to place on the screen. The cover for the camera lens came off after installing. Found it and cleaned it up and reinstalled it. Will see how it goes. Could live without it as I never had one on my previous phone. But it is a nice feature. Probably did not get it clean before application. Overall the kit is great. Would recommend it.

for iPhone 15 Case Clear - 5-in-1 Camera Lens and Glass Screen Protector,9,"My son got this for his new phone. He dropped it and the corner of the screen cracked. Another time he sat it down a little too hard and the screen protector cracked. This case is for looks only, do not recommend if you're trying to keep your phone in tact. No shock absorption at all."
for iPhone 15 Case Clear - 5-in-1 Camera Lens and Glass Screen Protector,9,"My biggest issue with this case is that, while the edges are raised (on the back) enough to prevent the camera lenses from causing your phone to wobble if flat on a table, it also makes it awkward to put into your pocket. It's not a smooth back and it's therefore not as slim as I'd like it to be. But it's definitely thick enough to provide good protection against drops, and it also does come with a hard cover for the camera lenses. Plenty of polishing and cleaning pads, and I must say that this is one of the best options for applying the screen protector... Place the frame down over the top of your phone, pull the tab, press out any air pockets, and you're good to go! Very easy to also gently peel back just the corner if there's a tiny ""dot"" of air or dust, and still stick perfectly. I literally can't even see anything except the very side edges, and once in a case, you can't even see the top or bottom edges of the screen protector. EXCELLENT! It's also great that it comes with 2, so you can keep one for later or just use it on another phone. So... Totally happy with the screen protector and application method; not loving the raised edges on the back of the case; and personally not using the camera lense covers (I prefer nothing over them so I'm sure to completely avoid unwanted reflections or haze effects). Over all, 4 out of 5 stars."
for iPhone 15 Case Clear - 5-in-1 Camera Lens and Glass Screen Protector,9,"Screen protectors for the new iPhone 15 Pro Max have been haphazard with most not properly fitting. They either cover up part of the display, have an awkward black trim that cuts into the display (to hide how poorly they align with the phone), or don't come with an installation frame.

I picked up this pack because of the two screen protectors with installer guide. I have a case for my iPhone 15 Pro Max and had no intentions of using this one because it isn't MagSafe. So, I will just get this out of the way: the case is hot garbage. It doesn't have MagSafe, it comes with thin plastic sheets on the back and front of the case that are difficult to remove, and there are mold injection circles on the back. Throw the case out and let it sit in a landfill for 1000 years, that's all it's good for.

The screen protectors aren't bad. The installer frame came with one installed and it was easy to put on my phone. It lines up well and doesn't cover the display. The second one was difficult to install in the frame and fell out while I was putting it on my other iPhone 15 Pro Max. Still, it was easy enough to fix.

These will do until different companies release better screen protectors that properly fit the iPhone 15 Pro Max's display."
for iPhone 15 Case Clear - 5-in-1 Camera Lens and Glass Screen Protector,9,This is a very nice kit and the screen protectors are easy to install with the frame tool. You get everything you need to protect your phone. The screen protectors do not cover the entire screen but leave a small area at the edge to allow for cases to fit without pushing on the screen protector. These fit my 15 Pro Max great. They perform as expected so I give them 4 stars.
for iPhone 15 Case Clear - 5-in-1 Camera Lens and Glass Screen Protector,9,"I was drawn to the method for screen protector installation, and it did not disappoint. The protector is exactly aligned, and the screen is dust free. It doesn‚Äôt have any cutouts, so it matches the phone display.

The edges are barely rounded, so running your fingers across isn‚Äôt a problem, but it‚Äôs not a smooth transition from phone to screen. In a case it doesn‚Äôt matter.

The edges of the protector are exactly aligned with the viewable display area, rather than overlapping like most protectors. It makes the border between the protector and the glass stand out as little more, and the border around the entire protector is larger than other protectors I‚Äôve tried with this phone.

After trying a few, I went back to this one for the screen protection.

It doesn‚Äôt appear to interfere with Face ID or the camera.

The case is ok, and it has the right cutouts and buttons, and includes a spot for a wristband or charm loop. It doesn‚Äôt have magnets so it doesn‚Äôt hold to magnetic mounts as well as cases which do have magnets. However, the back is perfectly clear so if you don‚Äôt like the MagSafe look, this case shows off the back of your phone very well.

I chose to use a different case as I use a lot of magnetic mounts.

The camera protection is nice and easy to install. I was impressed with how small the border is, and had no problem with it interfering with the other case design I use.

Overall this is a good kit, even if you don‚Äôt use one or two of its parts."
for iPhone 15 Case Clear - 5-in-1 Camera Lens and Glass Screen Protector,9,"Update: My very new iPhone 15 Pro popped off a bike handlebar holder and tumbled to the pavement. Its case held. The Masetech screen protector was unscathed but the lens protector area was not so lucky. It did its job and prevented anything from happening to the 3 camera lenses. For that I give the highest review possible!!

Prior review: An uncomplicated pack of protectors along with a basic case if you prefer one without the magsafe ring. The screen protector is nearly imperceptible when mounted and the frame tool kept it precisely aligned. As far as fit, the lens protectors match properly -- but I have not tested it enough to say whether there are any noticeable optical issues when used with angular light sources encountered.
The screen protectors were placed on a 'virgin' phone where the factory shield was only removed seconds before installation, so it was easy to avoid potential dust related bubbles. I did encounter what you might term nanoscale bubbles that needed to be 'massaged' out due to very tiny amounts of air that somehow made it under the protective film. While it took only a small amount of effort and careful pressure, it was resolved and the protector then looked immaculate. Getting a case is a bonus if you only need the protective covers from this particular kit."
for iPhone 15 Case Clear - 5-in-1 Camera Lens and Glass Screen Protector,9,The screen protector was super easy to install and I love that the cameras are protected. I haven't had any problems with it so far. The case is sturdy and comfortable to use.

for iPhone 15 Case Clear - 5-in-1 Camera Lens and Glass Screen Protector,9,"Got this to protect my new iPhone 15 Pro from scratches and dings. Although titanium is on the tougher and more durable side, it can aesthetically get scratched up. The transparent case was easy to slip on, and it only took seconds. The screen protector is tempered glass, and no bubbles were left on the screen after installation. There is a camera lens protector, which is a plus. Picture quality is not negatively impacted by it. Overall, this is a pretty solid set for anyone who just upgraded or got the iPhone 15 Pro (2023). Worth."
for iPhone 15 Case Clear - 5-in-1 Camera Lens and Glass Screen Protector,9,"I was surprised to see that this case and screen protector was available before the iPhone 15 Pro was officially released, so I decided to give it a try and see how it would work against all the other screen protector cases that are out there. It arrived before the official release of the 15 Pro Max, so it was waiting for the phones arrival. Once the phone arrived, it went from delivery box, straight into this case & screen protector kit.

If I was to summarize how easy it was to apply, and how well it protects the phone, all I can say is wow! It does a great job on both of these. Let me start with what's included in the box. It comes with two screen protectors, it comes with a screen applicator guide tool, a camera protector kit, and of course - it comes with a case protector with corner side airbags.

When it comes to applying the screen protector, you're able to easily slide it into the applicator tool. Just make sure that it's inserted correctly, so when you pull on the tab, it sticky side of the screen protector applies downward, and easily applies onto the iPhone display. Additionally, once applied - it has about a three-quarter to a 1 mm gap next to the edges. This is ok, because the case protector is actually elevated and raised a little. I haven't noticed any interactions after applying the screen protector, and the gap of the case, and I've seen this on numerous other screen protectors in the past. So it doesn't really have much of an impact on its functionality or its protection.

Once you line it up, the display protector actually lines up perfectly, and it's very symmetrical around the entire phones display. The application tool also fits over the iPhone 15 Pro Max as intended, almost as if it was perfectly suited for it. Just make sure that you follow the instructions on how to peel the tab, and also how to squeeze, any remaining pockets of air. Just make sure that when you start the screen protector bonding process, you start from the middle, so it applies onto the display from the middle outward to the edges of the screen. It will help in reducing the number of bubbles, and squeezing them out later as well. Do your best in order to make sure that the screen is also as clean as possible before applying, with no dust particles on it - so when you peel the tab back, you don't have any dust particles stuck underneath the display. It comes with stickers, so you can use them to remove any dust particles from the screen before hand. Use them even if you don‚Äôt see any dust particles, it‚Äôs better to use them even if you don‚Äôt see any, so that later you don‚Äôt find any stuck between the display/protecter thereafter. Once the protector is applied, that‚Äôs it - there‚Äôs no taking it off unless your discarding it.

It also comes with a protective cover cap for the tri-lens camera module. It actually fits really well, but it does leave a few bubbles underneath it. Not directly over the camera lens, but on the spaces between the cameras. I did my best to try to make it stick and apply permanently with no bubbles, but wasn't able to get it without any bubble residue. It doesn't really have an impact on the actual functionality of the camera, or the photos it takes, but I thought that may be the bubbles might go away after a week of use, but they still remain. The good thing about this camera protector, is that it actually fits into the phone protector case like a glove. It doesn't have any issues in regards to sliding into place correctly. It actually fits incredibly well.

When it comes to the case, just make sure that you peel off the protector plastic residue, which you can see in a few photos I provided from both the inside and outer side of the protector case. The protector cases is then nice and clear, and it looks beautifully once your iPhone is inserted inside of it. The iPhone also fits snugly inside the case, and the protector case allows the iPhones design and beauty shines through. The best part about this case that I haven't seen on many other case protectors out there, is the airbags on the corners. These airbags are incredibly important, because when you drop your phone and if it lands on the corner, it helps protect the phone and display glass. I've noticed this on other phone cases, and have even tested it by dropping it on its corner from a waist high height. You can even hear a pop every once in a while, where it's the airbag, taking the impact, with the screen and glass back of the phone being protected. I don‚Äôt recommend others out there to just drop and test this on their own, but if that day ever came where it falls accidentally, it will help protect the phone. When you hear this pop, it does sound scary, but it's actually the airbag doing its job. It also has about a half a millimeter to 1 mm raise lip on the display and backside, so that way when you put the phone on its back or screen face down, it actually lifts the phone up just enough, so that it doesn't scratch the display or back. I love this lip design, and helps reduce the number of scratches onto the display or the back of the phone protector.

The cutout for the USB-C is also really good, and I haven't had any issues connecting third-party USB-C cords into it. The grill openings for the speakers and mic are also well positioned, and haven‚Äôt had any sound or users complaining of not being able to hear me.

So now, how well does the case work? After a week of use, I haven't noticed any bubbles appear on the screen protector, and haven't noticed any yellowing of the case so far. Yellowing is something that obviously happens over time, and it's hard to predict if that's going to happen to this one, but ‚Äì so far it's working out really well, and I haven't noticed any yellowing of the case so far. In regards to gathering scratches, it has one little minor nick that it gained over the past week, and I'm happy that I had the phone protector case on it, as I'm sure it protected the phone from this type of damage.

As for the applied screen protector, it doesn't impact any functionality of the screen, and I'm still able to perfectly interact with iOS through it. I've also played a few games, and haven't noticed any issues in regards to functionality. One fun fact, I also put a little drop of water on the screen protector, and it actually bubbled up and slid around easily. So in a way, you could kind of tell that it appears to have a minor oleophobic coating on it. This is great, and haven't noticed any impact in regards to light coming through it from the display.

Overall, after a solid week of use, the screen protector in case have been top-notch. It's easy to apply, protects not only the camera and the corners with the airbags, but it still shows through the beauty and design of the phone. It also comes with an additional screen, protector and camera protector mount, so in case, if it gets cracked or scratched really bad, you're able to easily replace it. The only outlier is if it will yellow overtime, but that's something that won't show or reveal itself until months of use.

In the end, I give this case, camera and screen protector five out of five stars. I would recommend this product for others to buy, and think it's great value for the price for the protection it provides your phone. This is a great gift, and if you plan on buying an iPhone, I recommend that you order this case & kit before your new iPhone arrives, so that it goes straight from box into this protector kit. I‚Äôm very happy with this protector case."

"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,"I recently purchased this clear phone case with a tempered glass screen protector, lens protectors, and MagSafe compatibility, and overall, for my wife and we are quite pleased with it. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of what we've experienced so far:

Pros:

Comprehensive Protection: The inclusion of a tempered glass screen protector and lens protectors alongside the clear case is a huge plus. It feels reassuring to have a complete set of protection for my phone. The screen protector is particularly impressive; it's clear, responsive, and doesn't affect the touch sensitivity of my screen.

MagSafe Compatibility: The built-in MagSafe ring works seamlessly with my MagSafe charger and accessories. The alignment is spot-on, and charging is both efficient and secure. This feature was a key selling point for me, and it definitely lives up to the hype.

Clear and Sleek Design: The case itself is crystal clear and showcases the design of my phone without adding much bulk. The clarity of the case has not diminished over time, and it resists yellowing, which is always a concern with clear cases.

Cons:

Edge Protection: While the case provides decent coverage, the edges feel a bit more exposed compared to other cases I‚Äôve used. It‚Äôs not a deal-breaker, but I‚Äôd prefer slightly more cushion around the corners for added peace of mind against drops.

Lens Protectors Fit: The lens protectors are a good idea, but they can be a bit tricky to apply perfectly. I found myself spending a little extra time ensuring they were aligned correctly. Once in place, they do their job well, but a better application guide or pre-aligned design could improve this aspect.

Overall: This package offers excellent value with its all-in-one approach to phone protection and MagSafe compatibility. The minor issues with edge protection and lens protector application are outweighed by the benefits of having a clear, functional, and stylish case. I‚Äôd definitely recommend it for anyone looking to keep their phone safe while enjoying the benefits of MagSafe technology."
"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,"I ordered this item for my iPhone 15 pro max, which included a case, screen cover and camera lens protectors. The case is flexible and transparent. It is not slippery like some cases so you don‚Äôt have to worry about it sliding off the dashboard of a vehicle or other surface. The case and lens covers were very easy to install. The screen cover is something I always have issues with installing and this one was no different. I ended up having a few bubbles but this was not due to the quality of the product, likely just dust that floated onto my screen. If I would recommend one thing it would to be to include an install assist device for the screen. However this would likely increase the price. Overall it appears to be a great product and an excellent value compared to similar products. In addition I received quick response and resolution to a question I sent to the company. There was an issue with the QR code included not scanning. Janet from the ESR team immediately responded with a solution. So customer service appears to be excellent."
"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,"I love this case! I recently bought the magnetic charger and the previous case wasn‚Äôt compatible with that so I desperately needed a new one. The magnetic connection with the case on is equivalent to when there is no case, if not better (I mean seriously the charger does not move at all). The case seems to be really high quality and protective. My main concerns when I bought this were: 1. If the quality of the product was cheap and 2. If the magsafe component was reliable. Both concerns were kicked to the group because this case is amazing quality and magsafe component works extremely well. I am super satisfied. I purchased the all clear case for reference."
"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,"I purchased this phone case because I needed a MagSafe compatible case so that I could use a magnet pop socket! The ‚ÄúMagSafe‚Äù case I had previously mostly blocked the magnets from working on my charger. This case is wonderful! My magnets work super well, and the case fit my iPhone 13 Pro perfectly! I attached my new magnetic pop socket and it holds super well.
I love the clear design so that I can see the color of my phone through the case. My package came quickly!"
"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,"I have used two other clear case options before on my iPhone 13, the apple clear case, and the otterbox symmetry clear case. This case is certainly more plyable and less rigid than those other two options, especially the apple one, but I assume that this is a good thing especially with the cushioning material on the corners of the case. I haven't had any major drops with this case on but my phone has survived the ones that I have with no problem. This is also significantly cheaper than those cases I mentioned and I don't feel they provided any level of protection that is better enough to warrant the price difference. One other thing of note is the magsafe magnet on this phone is super strong. I got a magsafe wallet and when I put it on my apple clear case with an iphone 13 it doesn't grab strongly and will budge around, on this case, the wallet doesn't feel like it's going anywhere."
"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,"If you're looking for a slim and lightweight MagSafe case for your iPhone 15 Pro, The ESR clear/black option should make you happy. This case looks great and fits my 15 Pro very well.

The black edges have a nice smooth feel, but I wish they were a little more ""grippy."" The built-in MagSafe magnets provide wireless charging compatibility, while the clear back shows off the titanium finish of your iPhone Pro.

I am a little concerned with the case's protective qualities. The slim appearance comes at the cost of less protection around the most critical areas. The raised lip around the screen could be more robust, and I'd like to see more cushion around the frame, but I guess that's to be expected at this price-point. The edge around the lenses seems to work very well.

If you're serious about better drop protection, you should look at dual-layer or more rugged options instead. For me, this seems good enough for my day-to-day usage. I have a bulkier case if I'm heading out on an adventure. It will be interesting to see how this case holds up over time."
"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,"I recently purchased the ESR for iPhone 15 Pro Max Case, and it has truly exceeded my expectations in every way. Here‚Äôs why I highly recommend it:

### Design and Compatibility
The case is designed specifically for the iPhone 15 Pro Max and fits like a glove. It‚Äôs compatible with MagSafe, making wireless charging a breeze. The precise cutouts ensure that all buttons and ports are easily accessible, which is a significant plus.

### Protection
One of the standout features is its military-grade protection. I‚Äôve accidentally dropped my phone a couple of times, and this case has absorbed the impact beautifully, keeping my phone in perfect condition. The raised edges around the screen and camera offer extra protection against scratches and drops.

### Aesthetics
The clear design of the case allows the elegant look of the iPhone 15 Pro Max to shine through while providing robust protection. The yellowing-resistant material keeps it looking new and clear over time, which is a common issue with other clear cases I‚Äôve used in the past.

### Grip and Comfort
The case has a nice, firm grip that feels secure in hand, reducing the chances of accidental drops. It‚Äôs slim and doesn‚Äôt add unnecessary bulk to the phone, making it comfortable to hold and use daily.

### Conclusion
In summary, the ESR case for the iPhone 15 Pro Max is a perfect blend of style, functionality, and protection. It‚Äôs a great investment to keep your phone safe and looking pristine. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a reliable and stylish case!"
"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,"I have an iPhone 14 Pro. Please see all three reviews below:
One month review: Very pleased with my new clear case. Time will tell if it yellows as some have reported, but it appears that those that reported as much were mostly pleased with customer service. I‚Äôll check back in a few months to update.

The edge surrounding the camera lenses is higher than the lenses themselves, but only slightly. Ideally I would like a bit more protection, but this is adequate for flat surfaces.

After wiping down with a microfiber cloth it does not appear to a fingerprint problem. I wipe it down often, as I have done with all of my phones over the years. The edges are not overly ‚Äúgrippy,‚Äù but not slippery and has an overall good feel.

The magnetic field is very plenty strong, and the buttons all work well.

Six months update:
No yellowing and grip seems to have improved. Not experiencing any finger print issues, but an occasional wipe across your t-shirt doesn‚Äôt hurt.

Thirty minutes ago while looking elsewhere, I tripped over an unexpected top concrete step with phone in hand. I fell hard forward, putting my hands out to break my fall. Unfortunately, I had my phone in my hand and it slapped down hard onto a concrete sidewalk! Fortunately for me it was professionally installed and fairly smooth as concrete goes. Fearing the worst, I turned my phone over and was shocked to see only three little dings on my tempered glass screen protector, and no apparent damage to the screen itself!

I will be sticking with this brand in the future!

One month later, seven months:
The edges of the case have started to yellow a good amount. I cannot overlook the fact that the timing of this is in line with my installation of a new magnetic charger / mount in my car. Installed in an air vent, it is now a good deal higher than before and exposed to a lot more direct sunlight than before.
When I reached out to the manufacturer, I received a prompt response offering to replace the case under the two year warranty, but they did recommend a black case to replace it, after pointing out the various issues that might cause yellowing, especially direct sunlight. Despite this, I opted to replacing it with another clear case. It has served me well and I like the look. The replacement has already been shipped and I am extremely pleased with the prompt response and solution by the customer service team. I don‚Äôt know for certain, but I doubt a second replacement would be at no cost. In the meantime I will have to rethink the positioning of my car mount."
"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,"well I guess as much as a standard black phonecase can be. The case isn't opaque black like anticipated, HOWEVER it is opaque black for all the visibly darker spots in the advertised photo. The rest of the case is similar to a dark window tint. I bought this because I have the blue iPhone 13 Pro and generally dont like brighter colors for my phone, so when I saw the transparency I was worried, but it actually looks really good regardless."
"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,"I was having trouble with my case when a bottom part broke off, so reached out to ESR for support and the representative I spoke to (Fanny) was amazing and very helpful and was able to help me out with it. Case is easy to take on and off if needed which is a plus. Magnetic part works with a phone wallet I bought to go along with this case. I like how the silicone exterior provides grip when I have the phone in a large hoodie pocket so it doesn‚Äôt fall off. It is very sleek and doesn‚Äôt make the phone gigantic which is great."
"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,"Purchased this as a gift. Receiver used it for a few weeks with a multitude of chargers, but unfortunately none of them would work. Contacted ESR at their contact information provided through Amazon when I used that option from my previous orders.

I emailed over a holiday weekend, so I was expecting to wait until Tuesday for a reply, but got an email before 9:00AM Monday morning. I was given options for how I would like to solve my problem in that first email, which I appreciated very much. No one likes to go round and round with multiple emails with tech support before you can finally have your issue resolved. First email to select resolution option, second email resolution completed. üëçüèª

While the phone case, unfortunately did not work for me (and the recipient) I would not hesitate to try another product from ESR based on their customer service alone. I wish others would offer such easy customer service!"
"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,Hands down the best case I have ever owned. It looks thin but it protects your phone extremely well. I have dropped my phone multiple times on different job sites and there was no damage to the case or my phone. I was extremely surprised. My phone fell out of my truck going around 40mph and it just bounced. When I went to retire my phone I was fearing the worst. My phone was 100% operational and intact. The only damage sustained was some scuffs to the edges of the case. The mag safe works great as well and has strong magnets. I would 10 out of 10 recommend purchasing this case.
"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,"I love this case. I got it because my old clear one was yellowing and I wanted to try magsafe charging. I love how this feels in my hand - it's very soft like brushed powder. I haven't dropped my phone from a significant height yet, so I'm not sure how well it absorbs the shock, but I'll update if that happens. It seems to do well with smaller drops, tho."
"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,"Upon purchase, ESRgear expressed their commitment to me as a customer and said if anything is not up to par, contact them. This impressed me. So when the plastic grip nut cracked, I contacted ESR. Almost immediately they contacted me. I sent a picture and the new part was on the way.
My techie son told me this was the BEST charger. He was right. You step in the car and immediately attach it to magnetic secure base. No separate wires to mess with.
The little fan removes the concern about debilitating temperatures here in the Texas heat. I love this charger and this company. They actually put flesh on the saying, ‚ÄúWe care.‚Äù"
"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,"I love this case. So comfortable when holding, non-slip grip. Best of all, side buttons (on/off, volume, etc) are easily accessible. The ability to use the side buttons is very important to me. I had another brand that the side buttons were so difficult to access that I often took the case off. I have since thrown that case in the trash in lieu of this superior brand/design."

I‚Äôve had it for about a week already and there‚Äôs no scratches when it‚Äôs in my backpack, purse, or pockets with my keys. It‚Äôs easy to wipe prints and/or smudges no problem.

The sides are better to grab with this cover because it combines 2 materials. The clear material is hard and sides have a soft skin-like feel. The dark blue creates a nice look against the clear, which shows white metallic for my iphone. The clear material is high quality. I was impressed and now I love my 15 pro Max even more!!"

This is perfect and the value is lovely. It‚Äôs protected my phone for almost a year now and hasn‚Äôt taken any damage to it, or any discoloration. It‚Äôs super easy to take off to clean, it‚Äôs the perfect size, and the color came exactly how it looked in the pictures (I got black) definitely recommend to anyone reading this, and I‚Äôve recommended it to friends also."
"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,"Absolutely amazed with this purchase and buying another right after this review. Set my brand new iPhone on my suburban tire (knowing that was a terrible decision) left, forgot about it backed up and CRUNCH. I completely ran over the whole thing with a SUBURBAN and my phone is absolutely unharmed. My mind is blown and I‚Äôm soooo thankful for this product!!!! Like I said headed to buy another!"
"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,"The case itself is really nice and has so far taken several drops without any damage. One small issue is that one day I noticed the small magnetic stripe was sticking up when I took my phone out to clean it. Then I saw a bit of the magnet was broken and sticking out. Upon asking the customer service if that little bit of the magnet missing could be a problem, they sent a new case right away. It‚Äôs the little things sometimes that make a big difference in order to keep customers."
"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,"I decided to really do my research when I need a new MagSafe case for my iPhone 14 Pro. This one came up in the top 5 on almost all of the website lists I checked. One site even checked the actual magnet strength of each case tested. This ESR for iPhone 14 Pro MagSafe Case was the 3rd or 4th strongest.

So why did I go with this ESR for iPhone 14 Pro Case, Compatible with MagSafe instead of the stronger ones? Price. I cannot justify spending $60 or more on a phone case. This one cost less than $20.

My MagSafe wallet sticks so well to this case, I can't even shake the phone off while the wallet is open. Yes, part of that is the strength of the magnets on the case itself, but even my MagSafe charger holds tight.

The case has a raised lip around the screen to protect it when you place the phone face down. There is also a raised lip around the camera lenses. The buttons are very responsive, and the charging port is easily accessible if you need to use it. There are also other cut outs for the speakers .

Also, the corners are extra thick (padded). This is supposed to help protect your phone if you drop it, but the shape also helps you keep hold of your phone. It rests easily in your hand.

I think I just found my new favorite brand of MagSafe case. Let's face it, I will have to get a new phone eventually. Just not yet. ESR makes a MagSafe case for the new ones as well.

This ESR for iPhone 14 Pro Case, Compatible with MagSafe is the best MagSafe case for the price. Bar None!"
"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,"I love this phone case. I don‚Äôt know why but suddenly I just got on a phone dropping spree for some reason.. was wearing a lot of shorts with what can barely be described as a pocket I guess. Anyways I‚Äôve dropped this in concrete many times and there is not a single scratch on this phone case. I just wipe away the dust expecting some kind of damage, nothing. Looks nice too, sleek, not very grippy but still pretty easy to hold. Nothing bad I can really say about it."
"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,"I‚Äôve spent two weeks with this case so far and it‚Äôs already helped the phone survive a drop on tile and one on asphalt. I‚Äôll update a bit later into the case‚Äôs lifetime but I‚Äôm honestly already pretty impressed. It‚Äôs not bulky at all, and it‚Äôs machined well; all the features on the case are sized and spaced appropriately for an iPhone (Pro 14, in my case). The clear material is slightly tacky, compared with the Apple brand, which helps grip in hand without being, like, sticky. The raised lip around the screen protects well and the slight bumpered corners help absorb impact from tumbles without adding the kind of bulk that affects its fit in pockets, which is really nice (the old Ballistic brand cases had the best corner protection but it cost me being able to fit the phone in places I wish I could have, sadly‚Äîthis seems like a good tradeoff so far).

The shape of the camera guard also diffuses the flashlight glow a bit so I can get just a little, indirect light from it when it‚Äôs face down on a surface, which is often perfect and one of the selling points of the clear Apple case I had before. I don‚Äôt think this will work with the opaque cases. Hopefully this material is resistant to the yellowing/browning that happened to the Apple case (barely lasted a year).

As of right now I‚Äôd say get this if you want a well-built, basic case at a decent price that stands up to realistic drops and accidents. Good chance I‚Äôll still say that by time this one retires, too."

When my first one finally cracked, I bought a different one with the magnetic option as I use a pop socket wallet. The replacement failed too many times from day one.

This guy fit the bill, and she has been very pleased. Super great magnet, snaps on to everything MagSafe, and holds without worry. The case itself is nice, buttons click well, and best of all, my wife is happy with it. Would recommend, especially at the price point. I‚Äôve paid much more, for much worse."
"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,"I traded my iPhone 12 Pro Max for a 15 Pro Max this weekend. I'd kept the 12 in a black Otterbox case which protected the phone but was bulky and starting to come apart around the edges. It was also difficult to remove the phone and put it back in. It also sometimes didn't make good contact with the mag chargers.

For the 15, I got this clear case from ESR. Easy to install and remove. Works perfectly with my mag mount in the car and my mag charger at home. It's a little smaller than the Otter so it's easier to fit into the mount on my ebike, too. Most importantly, it protects the phone and has a nice edge to protect the camera lenses. Finally, all the slots for buttons on the phone match up perfectly."

My phone was dropped going 30 mph from a 4 wheeler and the case totally protected the phone. However, the lens covers cracked within about a week of having the case without having any drops. I reached out to customer service and they issued a full replacement immediately. I will absolutely recommend this brand to friends and family!"
"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,"This has been a phenomenal case. I drop my phone probably every day -- on hardwood floors, on granite countertops, and of course, on the pavement when I get out of the car. Not once did my phone get dinged. The case shows no signs of wear, save for the slight yellowing that has occurred. This is to be expected -- no TPU case is truly yellow-proof. One of the best things about this case is the extra MagSafe-compatible magnet ring built into it. I use the MagSafe connection not only for charging, but also for quickly mounting my phone to MagSafe-compatible phone stands, tripods, and magnetic ceiling mounts (for use as an extra camera at church). Never have I worried about my phone falling off of a mount. This is truly the best phone case I have ever used."

It fits my phone perfectly, is protective without being bulky, feels great to hold, and it allows the magnet to work when needed.

For the first six months, the case looked great, allowing the phone to be clearly seen. However, I then started noticing the discoloration and yellowing common to clear cases, and now it just looks kind of dirty and gross even though it‚Äôs clean.

If I were happy to get a good six months out of the case for this price, I‚Äôd be satisfied, but I prefer getting more use. Still earned four stars from me because I really did like it."

However, as soon as I snapped it onto my iPhone 13 Pro Max, I knew this was a great purchase. Some important things I noticed immedately:
- I care a lot about how strong the MagSafe is, because I use a lot of Mag accessories. This magnet is STRONG. Stronger than the Apple Silicone case I am changing from. This was a huge plus for me.
The magnet is so strong, that my accessories don't move while attached, which is an issue I had with an otterbox because the material was smooth like this plastic case. But this issue doesn't exist on this ESR phone case.
- The lips around the front of the phone come up high enough where I think the screen will be protected in case of a fall. I do not use a screen protector.
- there is extra padding on each of the corners. Nice touch.

Since this is my first day with the case, I have no idea if one day in the future this clear plastic case will become ""sunburnt"" and turn yellow. That is usually the case with clear cases but we'll see - I am pretty happy with this quality and price so far."

My previous case let the iPhone fall out if it hit the ground or something else hard. It works easily with MagSafe chargers, too, the others I had to often remove in order to use either the MagSafe or another Qi charger."
"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,"I was looking for a replacement case that was Chrystal clear and allowed the beauty of my iPhone to shine through. This case fits the bill. Not only was it clear, it was MagSafe so I was still able to use all my wireless charge=ing devices with the phone!!"
"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,Great case. My old one had begun yellowing and was in need of a replacement. Ordered this one and it‚Äôs nice and elegant. Not too bulky and I still get to show off my phone. The camera lense guard on the back is also a nice and much appreciated. 10/10
"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,This one piece case works GREAT on iphone 15 Plus using Anker finger ring. Very strong and i don't worry about finger ring detaching from case easily when dropping phone from sofa to carpet like with other more expensive cases i purchased at Apple store. I haven't tried charging phone with case on because i don't have a mag charger.
"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,This phone case is exactly what I was looking for and meets all of my expectations. Surprisingly I‚Äôve dropped my phone 3 times since purchasing this case and nothing has happened which makes me happy! The magnet feature is also very strong! I highly recommend.
"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,"I purchased this blue clear case for my yellow iPhone 14 to replace my old one. I love that the edges of the case are colored but the back is clear so I can see my pretty yellow phone! Hopefully this will help with discoloration that all clear cases seem to suffer from (that dingy yucky brown/ yellow color). My last case was so slippery and I kept dropping it. This case seems to provide a nice grip and I‚Äôve yet to lose hold of it. The magnetic circle (MagSafe) is very strong! It keeps my pop socket firmly attached and I don‚Äôt have any worry at all that it will fall off or get torn off by accident. I was hoping I could find a case with yellow edges that would match my phone exactly, but no one seems to offer that color. The blue goes well with yellow and matches my Harry Potter owl pop socket so it works great! Sorry about the lighting in the photos, but hopefully you‚Äôll get the idea if you have a yellow phone and are looking for something that will match and not look weird. Highly recommend!"
"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,"The case itself is really nice and the ESR magnet is very strong, so that's my favorite part about the case. However, my phone fell out of my front pocket when I was trying to sit down and the inside of the case cracked near the camera. It barely fell 1 foot, so I'm not sure how well this case is going to hold up. I reached out to customer service and they responded promptly and were willing to send me a new one, which is awesome! I will still use the case, I just hope that one case was a faulty one and I have better luck with the new one. I do recommend buying from them because they know how to treat their customers well! Bumping down to 4 stars just because of the questionable durability."

I highly recommend it to anyone looking to protect their iPhone 14 Pro Max with a touch of class."

The magnet is really strong. The case is very slim and doesn‚Äôt make the phone feel bulky. I haven‚Äôt dropped it yet so I don‚Äôt know how well that works. I only wish it came in more colors.
"ESR for iPhone 14 Case/iPhone 13 Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Shockproof Military-Grade Protection, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 14/13, Classic Hybrid Case (HaloLock), Clear",13,"This case has broken the fall of an iPhone 15 Pro onto concrete or gravel too many times to count. The screen protector broke during one of those falls, but the iPhone itself has held up through each fall a-okay.

The only thing subtracting a star is how the appearance holds up over time. It started a brilliant and shining phone case, making up for the sides of the iPhone no longer being glossy like the 13 pro. Now, the case is dulling and yellow on the sides. It detracts from the look of the phone. It happened even though I clean my phone and case regularly. If the anti-yellowing held up as well on the sides as it held up on the back, this would be a five star case.

I submitted a warranty claim or support ticket about the yellowing case. Exposure to water, skincare products, and sunlight can cause yellowing. ESR support offered the same case but the clear black color as a replacement. I will likely be updating the review once I have used the clear black case

Overall, the case has good protection and doesn‚Äôt have thin easily-breakable plastic around the charging port and speakers."

It feels really durable and sturdy. It is easy to install and I love that it comes over the edges of the front of my iPhone. Most cases don‚Äôt do that. The space around the camera protrudes in order to slightly keep the camera safe and I really like that feature as well. It‚Äôs MagSafe and just a great case overall. Highly recommend!

I am constantly taking my phone out of my pocket and sliding it back in, and most every case I've had has either been bulky and held up, or thin and eventually cracked or ripped. This case has been able to hold up to the wear and tear of use while still being thin enough to slip into my pocket with ease."

It is a good product. It is sleek and looks nice and performs its function. I dropped the phone two or three times from a few feet above ground and the phone suffered no damage. The one caveat is that the surface is very grippy and will pull things out of your pocket it is touching. For example, I lost a metro card and some cash because the case gripped onto them when I pulled my phone out of my pocket and I didn‚Äôt realize it. You have to beware and take appropriate measures to prevent this from happening because it happened on more than the two occasions where I actually lost something important. I just didn‚Äôt happen to notice those times. It‚Äôs not really a fault of the case so it‚Äôs still five stars, but something to beware of."

Easy to install, hasn‚Äôt lifted up anywhere or lose any sort of tightness. I bought this like before june (it‚Äôs july now) and there‚Äôs no scratches at all on it. It also feels really smooth."

I typically take good care of my phone but accidents do happen. My phone dropped a couple of times onto the concrete floor of my garage and it literally just bounced with no damage to the case or phone.
What impressed me most however was the excellent customer service I received when I wrote to ESR about the discoloration of my case. They were very understanding and accommodating.

However, I ran into some trouble during our road trip to Disneyland. Unfortunately, this case isn't compatible with MagSafe, so it doesn't attach to a magnetic car phone holder. While it feels amazing in hand, it's too thick to stay securely on the phone stand, which isn't ideal for long drives.

It has also been dropped a couple of times (oops I‚Äôm a bit of a klutz) and, although it withstood the impact, there are a few small bits missing now. With two small toddlers, I just can't take that chance. You feel me?

I will be returning because I need MagSafe tech. But if I didn‚Äôt, I would be keeping it since it‚Äôs beautiful and a joy to hold."

"elago Compatible with iPhone 14 Pro Case, Liquid Silicone Case, Full Body Protective Cover, Shockproof, Slim Phone Case, Anti-Scratch Soft Microfiber Lining, 6.1 inch (Stone)",12,"This is definitely high quality silicone, I just did notice that if you have pets their hair will easily stick to the phone case, as well as dust or any crumbs. It‚Äôs very cute and easy to put onto your phone. The only other issues is that this case is very slippery so if you place your phone in a certain standing position or leaning it will slip. Also if you have it in your hand for too long and your laying down it will slip out of your hand."

While in Alaska on a whale watching excursion, I was on the observation deck of the boat videoing when a gentleman bumped into me knocking my phone out of my hand and over the edge it went. My phone fell down to the bottom deck landed on the corner of the walking edge of the boat that had a sandpaper like material. Due to the rubber coating and the sandpaper like material it stopped it from going into the water. The only damage was to the corner of the case which broke but there is not a scratch or chip of any kind on my phone."

The other day I did the extreme and left it on the roof of the car, it fell off eventually and I heard it so I turned around when possible and got it. Luckily it was not run over but even with the rough fall going 60 mph, only thing damaged was the case and a couple small cracks in two of my cameras. Just recently took my screen protector off too so I thought it was going to be shattered. Needless to say I will be getting a new one of this case, it protected my phone very well."

It‚Äôs got a nice snug fit and looks so clean and crisp. I‚Äôve bought this silicone kind before and they last about a year. It truly protects the corners of my phone without all the bulkiness.

"elago Compatible with iPhone 14 Pro Case, Liquid Silicone Case, Full Body Protective Cover, Shockproof, Slim Phone Case, Anti-Scratch Soft Microfiber Lining, 6.1 inch (Stone)",12,"I recently purchased the elago Compatible with iPhone 14 Pro Max Case in the Stone color option, and I am extremely satisfied with its performance and design. This liquid silicone case offers full-body protection for my iPhone, ensuring its safety against everyday bumps, drops, and scratches.

The first thing I noticed about this case is its slim and sleek design. It adds minimal bulk to my iPhone 14 Pro Max, maintaining its slim profile while providing excellent protection. The precise cutouts for the camera, ports, and buttons ensure easy access and functionality without hindrance.

The liquid silicone material used in the construction of this case feels smooth and comfortable to hold. It provides a secure grip, preventing accidental slips and ensuring that the phone feels solid in my hand. The soft touch of the silicone is pleasant and adds a premium feel to the overall experience.

The shockproof feature of this case has been impressive. It effectively absorbs impact and disperses it across the case, safeguarding my iPhone against accidental drops and knocks. The reinforced corners and raised edges around the screen and camera offer additional protection, reducing the risk of damage in vulnerable areas.

The microfiber lining inside the case adds an extra layer of protection against scratches. It keeps the back of my iPhone free from dust particles and prevents any potential scratches caused by friction between the case and the phone‚Äôs surface.

Another aspect that I appreciate about this case is its compatibility with wireless charging. I can easily charge my iPhone 14 Pro Max wirelessly without the need to remove the case, providing a hassle-free charging experience.

In terms of color options, the Stone color I chose adds a subtle and sophisticated touch to my iPhone. It complements the device‚Äôs design beautifully and gives it a unique and stylish look.

Overall, the elago Compatible with iPhone 14 Pro Max Case is a fantastic choice for those seeking a slim, protective, and stylish case for their iPhone.

Love the color and phone feels pretty secure. However, its weirdly slippery to where it falls out if my hands. Even as im typing this review. Hoping it gets better over tome"
"elago Compatible with iPhone 14 Pro Case, Liquid Silicone Case, Full Body Protective Cover, Shockproof, Slim Phone Case, Anti-Scratch Soft Microfiber Lining, 6.1 inch (Stone)",12,These cases are made differently depending when you purchase it and what color you get. I got the stone color a while ago and wanted to replace it since it‚Äôs worn down. The stone I just received is a little thinner and feels a little different. I ordered the brown and it‚Äôs the same as my old stone so I don‚Äôt know why they are changing the way they make certain colors. I didn‚Äôt like the brown color so returned it and didn‚Äôt like the new material of the stone so returned as well. But the old stone was perfect I wish I could get the same one again
"elago Compatible with iPhone 14 Pro Case, Liquid Silicone Case, Full Body Protective Cover, Shockproof, Slim Phone Case, Anti-Scratch Soft Microfiber Lining, 6.1 inch (Stone)",12,"Love the color and texture of this case and although I was scared of lint from my pockets and clothes getting stuck on the silicone, I found that whenever that happened, I just needed to blow it off and everything came off at once. It also kept the color and hasn‚Äôt faded.

Unfortunately the case corners chipped and one side separated to the point of almost falling off, making it necessary to get a new case if I wanted my phone to stay protected. All this wear and tear happened in under a year."

Soft feel. Does not come with any sort of glass protection. Relatively thin , so imagine it won‚Äôt provide too much high impact drop protection. Great case for older teen who won‚Äôt be dropping it out of his/her pocket very 15 minutes. Cheap and washable."
"elago Compatible with iPhone 14 Pro Case, Liquid Silicone Case, Full Body Protective Cover, Shockproof, Slim Phone Case, Anti-Scratch Soft Microfiber Lining, 6.1 inch (Stone)",12,Love this case! The quality and color are amazing. Only downfall is that it is super hard to get in and out of pockets cause it sticks from being rubber.

"elago Compatible with iPhone 14 Pro Case, Liquid Silicone Case, Full Body Protective Cover, Shockproof, Slim Phone Case, Anti-Scratch Soft Microfiber Lining, 6.1 inch (Stone)",12,It‚Äôs more of a light grey but still a nice phone case
"elago Compatible with iPhone 14 Pro Case, Liquid Silicone Case, Full Body Protective Cover, Shockproof, Slim Phone Case, Anti-Scratch Soft Microfiber Lining, 6.1 inch (Stone)",12,"I‚Äôve bought this case twice now. The first color was purple and I had to replace it after about a year of ware and tear (the case is rubber). The edges had broken a bit and my phone has some small nicks in it from the case being broken in the corners. The replacement has kept up nicely so far. I got pink this time, but it looks slightly purple. I still like it as it serves its purpose."
"elago Compatible with iPhone 14 Pro Case, Liquid Silicone Case, Full Body Protective Cover, Shockproof, Slim Phone Case, Anti-Scratch Soft Microfiber Lining, 6.1 inch (Stone)",12,"I switched to this case from a gripmunk case by smartish, the gripmunk case gave me a callus on my pinky finger where my phone rest. I have small hands. I have always liked the soft buttery feel of liquid silicone and after several months of the sand paper feel on the gripmunk I needed to switch.
I will admit the the gripmunk by smartish holds the MagSafe wallet, power pack and charger like a beast! You have to pry them off. So maybe my expectations were too high for this case but everything basically slips off. There is no way I could throw the power pack or wallet on and put it in my diaper bag or purse and expect it to be there when I took it out. Even putting on the MagSafe charger I have to slide it around to find the sweet spot and then not move it around.
If they used a stronger magnet I would give it 5 stars.

Pros‚Ä¢ super soft buttery feel
Velvety inside so your phone doesn‚Äôt get scratched
Seems like decent protection for people who are easy on their phones
Tons of colors
Great price point

Cons‚Ä¢ MagSafe doesn‚Äôt work great

So if you are specifically looking for MagSafe options I‚Äôd go with another option, like if you need your wallet to be secure.
Otherwise I think this case is good and meets my other expectations."

It's like an affordable version of the silicone Apple cases. I got it back in 2022 and I am still using it and it still looks the exact same, no wear and tear really! I will say, if you're not into silicone cases, you do have to be aware that sometimes fuzz will stick to the case, but it has never been so much that it bothers me. You would get that with any silicone case. This case is definitely easy to clean."

In fact, I am quite put off by the flexible rubber around operating buttons - it flops with a simple movement of a thumb. In Apple cases, it sits tightly around the phone and does not feel less sturdy than the rest of the case. It's not going to last long, I presume."

It‚Äôs not too bulky and does a great job protecting my phone. It‚Äôs also easy to get on and off so I can clean.

I haven‚Äôt changed it yet though, so it doesn‚Äôt bother me too much."

They messaged me after my review and sent me a new case for free because of my other one breaking.

At first I loved this case because it was very soft. However, I bought it in September and now it‚Äôs only November and it‚Äôs already breaking. This has just been from daily use. The case also catches every piece of dirt and lint from your pocket. Disappointed that it has only lasted me 2 months‚Ä¶will have to be buying a new case and unfortunately I won‚Äôt be spending money on another one from here considering it does not last long at all before breaking."

My last otter box was all thick rubber. Pop in and go. This had a thin rubber case around the phone with a hard cover shell over the top.

I couldn‚Äôt get them to pair up together. Someone else had to put it together for me. This one is much lighter and I question if it had the same quality as my rubber case had but was told yes. We will see because I am a dropper of the cellphone. I just pray it works out.

"OtterBox iPhone 15, iPhone 14, and iPhone 13 Commuter Series Case - BLACK, slim & tough, pocket-friendly, with port protection",34,"On my previous phones (Samsung) I'd buy as many combos of phone cover/holsters with belt clip as needed to RAM mount a holster in each of my vehicles and clip on a tool belt. This has served me well ever since upgrading to smart phones so the same combo was ordered for my new iPhone 15. My wife inherited my S22 (an upgrade for her) but didn't like the case and had no need for a holster so she ordered an OtterBox case and wow, I really like it. Not only does it do a great job of phone protection but all these years my cases have had cut-outs for the buttons, effectively making them recessed and not very tactile, whereas this case is just the opposite. The button controls are pronounced or raised off the case making them very easy to find and operate only by feel. So now I'm using a phone pouch on my tool belt and magnetic ""puck"" chargers on RAM mounts in cars. Unfortunately the magnets aren't powerful enough to work through this case so it required cutting a hole in the back (both layers) to accommodate the magnets, which actually makes them hold better because the case stops any tendency to slide off the magnet if seriously agitated. I think a camo case would be cool, even if it was just the hard plastic layer while the soft layer remained black or another complimentary color. For the iPhone this is a little pricey for what it is (Samsung model was cheaper) but over the life of your phone its pennies per day."

I got a screen and lens protector added to the phone. The very first drop shattered the camera lens cover. I may replace this with a more robust version if it‚Äôs available"
"OtterBox iPhone 15, iPhone 14, and iPhone 13 Commuter Series Case - BLACK, slim & tough, pocket-friendly, with port protection",34,"The new friction based design leaves the top corners of the phone vulnerable. The case slides off too easily and as a result I have had a few dings on the top corners of my iPhone 15 from falls of just a few feet.

I buy Otterbox for the ultimate protection of my phone, and this product has let me down in that regard. Previous designs have left my phone spotless. Overall still a decent case, but a cheaper case would have done a better job at protecting the corners of my phone from small falls."

Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,"I originally wasn‚Äôt going to buy a wallet like this for the price that Apple has posted, but the fact that this works with the Find My app was what sold me on it. It fits a drivers license with one credit card comfortably. Adding a second credit card will all fit, but makes it a little bit tight to get the card out. I have also been able to fit one license, two credit cards and a folded dollar bill and while it is all tight, it all fits. I don‚Äôt think I could fit any more than that. What more do you need, really? The construction is solid. The sides of this wallet won‚Äôt be splitting. I expect this to last a long time."
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,"I‚Äôm surprised by how much I like this wallet. The build quality is excellent‚Äîvery nice indeed. I‚Äôve been using it for a little over a month and a half, and it‚Äôs held up well so far.

I would love to compare it to the previous leather versions. My friend has a leather one that still looks new after a few years. I also purchased the FineWoven Case, which didn‚Äôt hold up as well as I had hoped, so I was unsure about the durability of the wallet.

As for capacity, it can fit up to three cards max, which is perfect for a driver‚Äôs license and two credit cards. The design is great, especially for times when you don‚Äôt have pockets and want to keep your phone and wallet together.

Overall, I highly recommend this wallet and give it five stars."
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,"I loved the leather apple wallet, if it weren't for my toddler hiding it somewhere I wouldn't of had the need to buy a ""fine woven"" wallet.

Firstly, the connection, it is significantly weaker than the leather wallets magnet for whatever reason. The only times the old wallet would come off was when I was taking it out of my jean pockets and that was only occasionally. Basically the pick-up/put down rate of wallet detachment went from ~5-10% to 30-40%.

Second quality, leather is relatively stain repellant and it lasts, this fine woven stuff doesn't. I'm sure apple is just pandering here by saying they are not consuming cow products just so they can charge the same amount for cloth vs leather and fatten up their margin. I know the apple cafeteria at their HQ serves beef so this is just margin maintenance for them under disguise of 'caring'. Hypocrites.

Third value, goes in line with line with item number two. You're getting a woven wallet for $50, this isn't worth the money.

Conclusion: Go gets your self a decent wallet for $50 made of leather that will last and you at least will conclusively that it won't be connected to your phone ever rather than having to play the guessing game."
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,This is a very cool accessory. Works well with my iPhone 15. If it was to every fall off from your phone it notifies you right away. Its card capacity is 1 maybe 2. The material is a nice leather very durable and pretty. No installation needed iPhone knows what it is as soon as you connect it to the magnet ring on the back of your phone.
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,"This thin wallet is perfect for my phone. I typically carry 2-3 cards/id with me. It has a smooth fees, and holds cards firmly. It stays on firmly when i put the phone in my pocket as well."
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,"This newer version has a stronger magnet, making the grip on my phone case tight. I appreciate that! It holds 3 cards and doesn‚Äôt stretch out. My only complaint is that I have to remove the wallet from my phone to get any cards out. Not sure how to resolve that, but it is a tiny hassle. I‚Äôve been using it daily for a couple of months and it‚Äôs held up really well!"
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,"I think the FineWoven material has been described accurately ‚Äî it‚Äôs feels like suede and I don‚Äôt think it will wear well. I didn‚Äôt find it to scratch that easily, but scratches do show quite prominently (especially with this color).

I really wanted to like this, given the Find My compatibility, but the single reason I‚Äôm returning it is because of the magnet strength. The magnet just isn‚Äôt as strong as other options available (I like the Pop Socket MagSafe wallets a lot!). You wouldn‚Äôt need the Find My capability if the magnet was stronger! Also the Find My feature only tells you where the wallet was detached. It doesn‚Äôt track the wallet in real time like it does with other devices.

Lastly, the cards cannot be removed from the wallet with ease. I was able to comfortably fit three ‚Äúflat‚Äù cards (no raised numbers) in the wallet. However, in order to get any of them out, you need to detach the wallet and use the hole in the back to push them up. This would something I would‚Äôve been willing to forgive, but in combination with the magnet strength, it was a shortcoming. It would be nice if there was a notch at the bottom that would let you push up the cards instead."
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,"I was skeptical about getting this case. It holds three cards as described, but the fact that when you remove the cards from the phone, the phone alerts you if you leave it behind. When it comes to cards i don't want to lose while I'm out and about or on vacation and don't want a full wallet. This is the go to to limit the use of space in pockets and keeps things comfortable. I've since bought in a few other colors."
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,"Not the replacement leather wallet I was looking for but I am still pleased with the quality of FineWoven. It‚Äôs very soft and comfortable on the back of the iPhone. The only issue is the old MagSafe wallet fit two cards snugly and this one is very loose with only two cards. So, it will fit 3+ cards nicely."
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,Good wallet although the cards struggle to come out.
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,This wallet matches perfect with my phone case and it holds well on the MagSafe. Never worried about losing the wallet again!
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,Love the Apply wallet. It‚Äôs easy to setup to phone for location notifications and good to have a few cards always on hand.
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,I love the feel of it. It doesn‚Äôt stick out on the phone and it feels extremely durable.
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,My dog chewed up my last one. Love these wallets.
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,"I just got my wallet. No, I didn‚Äôt read the details or reviews. I hope this gets to you if you are on the fence about getting this wallet for a high price. IT IS WORTH IT!

***Overview***
I haven‚Äôt had it for long, so I cannot determine long term durability. However it does feel like it is made well and sturdy. I‚Äôve had off brand wallets but this feels better. The magnet is stronger than the old faux wallet‚Ä¶and I do mean significantly stronger. The materials are suede though I would have preferred patented leather, faux leather, or vegan leather that could be easier to clean/wipe down. With suede, you know water will make it look bad, scratches will show up, and overall it will eventually show its use. Like all of these wallets you can fit 3 standard cards. My old one could fit a forth after stretching, this one can actually fit my 4th card (note that two of my cards are thing and together are about the thickness of a standard card). How do you get the cards out, this takes some knowledge of having used this type of wallet‚Ä¶most will pull of the wallet from their phone, put their thumb on the slit in the back and try to push up their cards. Wrong! For those that do not know: take you wallet of the back, from the top of your wallet put you thumb on the slit, you other finger in a pinching motion on the front side of the wallet, pinch and pull. This will slide your cards out in a control fashion. You cards will end up in your hands not struggling to come out where someone can snatch it.
***Why is it worth the price!***
***Finally, the FIND MY feature is activated! I didn‚Äôt even assume this was a feature for wallets and makes the price worth it. Other Faux wallets do not have this feature.

If they come out with a wallet that can be cleaned easily, I‚Äôll definitely get it.

Edit: This is not suede. I was out in the sun and realized it‚Äôs MICROFIBER."
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,Great product
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,Ok I didn‚Äôt read the description and didn‚Äôt realize it‚Äôs woven and not leather. I was angry about that at first but I do like the texture and I think it will hold up better than the leather version. I have an iPhone 13 mini silicone case (MagSafe) by Apple in the color Abyss blue and it does match the wallet color Pacific blue. It holds 2 standard cards well.
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,Good product! Really useful and good view!
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,"It's crazy that this is my wallet now, but it's nice to carry less.

Definitely clings on well, and I'm not worried about it coming off, but if it did, having the built-in AirTag is great peace of mind. The material is nice, almost suede-like, and it seems to hold up well to the constant in and out of my pocket so far.

Tip: take it off to get your cards out using the hole on the back."
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,This is a nice wallet if your someone like me who uses Apple wallet app and only need to carry very minimal cards. It has a great feel to the touch. I‚Äôve always hated the bulk of wallets which always had me leaving it in the console of my truck. Only 4 stars because for something so minimal it is very expensive and for the price as other have stated I feel the magnets aren‚Äôt worth the money. It has a tendency to pull the wallet off if I‚Äôm not really careful when putting my phone in my pocket .
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,"Really wanted this wallet to work, but ridiculously difficult to get cards out. Pros and Cons below:

Pros:
- Magnet seems strong enough; didn't test getting in/out of pockets but again seemed well-connected
- Looks great; sleek, not bulky, simple

Cons:
- Really have to wrestle to get a card out. Just ridiculously difficult. The hole in the back (designed to be able to push a card out with your thumb) is inadequate; really needs a small cutout at the bottom where you can actually push the cards out.

Summary:
I bought this to consolidate wallet with phone, day-to-day and also travel. For me the absolute minimum is 3 cards (drivers license, credit card, debit card in case I need cash for emergency). This wallet might work OK with 2 cards (no idea how secure it would be, did not test). But 3 cards is way too tight; it was irritating trying to get the cards out while sitting at my desk, so I can only imagine how irritating it would be, both to myself and others, at a point of sale or airport security line. A few minor design tweaks by Apple though and this could be the perfect product."
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,It matches my Apple case exactly and is so sturdy.
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,"These are great little attachments, only drawback is the cost like Any Apple product !"
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,this was my first FineWoven accessory and I can tell that I am not a fan because of its roughness. the magnet is strong although it's not as strong as my previous leather one. especially at the buttom the magnet is not strong and it swings away from the center. I've got it for some weeks and it already started to wear out
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,Has find my iPhone which is nice bc if you lose it you can trac it on the phone. I can comfortably fit 2 cards and one bill but can squeeze in 3 when need be. Was worried about getting suede bc of how it would get dirty easily but so far it‚Äôs just the edges. Also the magnetic connection is not that strong if you drop your phone it‚Äôll fall off
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,"The magnetic attachment is strong but make sure you have a case that also supports MagSafe, otherwise the magnets wont stick though even a regular clear case. The animation appears when attached to your phone and begins setup through find my but NOTE: THIS WALLET DOES NOT HAVE AIRTAG FEATURES!! Which means you can‚Äôt use your iPhone to track the wallet or anything like that although: you can mark it as lost and anyone who finds it HAS to attach it to their supported phone and your phone number will pop up. A little misleading but is nice that when your wallet is detached, you‚Äôll get a notification from find my about a minute after its not reattached. Overall the fine woven material gets dirty fast even with light wear and tear. Corners hold up very well and wont peel, but it can only hold about three cards max."
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,"I will admit that I did not need this. I had a perfectly good wallet but I used to have a Ghostek iPhone case that had a built in wallet and honestly, I did enjoy having my wallet attached to my phone.

This wallet is very nice. The magnet is very strong and I have full confidence that it will not come off unless I take it off. However, I am using a MagSafe case and it is with an iPhone 15 so I can‚Äôt speak for any other combination. The Find My feature is a nice touch as well. I would‚Äôve preferred the OG leather wallet but the new material is nice. It‚Äôs basically neoprene."
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,"product is identical to previous leather versions, works with find my. scuffs and marks much easier"
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,"I have researched and shopped around for a MagSafe wallet for the iPhone 15 Pro Max for a while. Tested a few. The Apple MagSafe wallet is as good as they're getting (where MagSafe wallets are concerned), in my opinion.

PRO's:
- Utilizes the FindMy feature, if the wallet becomes detached from the phone. Making recovery easier than other contemporary MagSafe wallets.
- Solid magnification of wallet to iPhone - IRRESPECTIVE of the case. I used a third party case, and the magnetization is still strong and holds - especially compared to other MagSafe third party wallets I tested.
- Holds three cards.
- Very soft texture on the FineWoven material. Tactile speaking - this feels like quality and luxurious. It's different from other contemporaneous textiles currently being used.

CONS:
- Overpriced. Though I got mine from Amazon at $45 (compared to Apple's price tag)
- Poor ergonomics and design. The user still has to remove the MagSafe wallet, in order to retrieve the cards. Based on my last Apple MagSafe wallet in leather, this action will cause erosion and deterioration of the product. The Jury is still out on the duration of the FineWoven fabric compared to the leather.
- Will the FineWoven last longer and withstand daily wear, tear, and stains?

Three weeks into product: product rating moved from 4/5 to 5/5. Patina of the product has not declined. If you can get this product for under $60 - it‚Äôs worth it."
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,"this was a perfect gift for my son in law, he LOVES it"
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,"This works great, but for me it was more trouble than useful. First my one credit card that I kept in it fell out one time in my pocket (luckily). Therefore I lost trust in it. Another real pain in the ass is you need to take it off when you need to use another MagSafe device with your phone. The good news is that the phone will tell you where it‚Äôs off and were it is. Put that‚Äôs too much takings on and off to make it worthwhile for me. I would have returned it but I discovered these inconveniences several days after my last return date.

It‚Äôs made good and stays on your phone fine if you don‚Äôt mind having to remove it for wireless charging and to use other MagSafe products."
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,Other than only holding 3-4 cards I love everything about it. It tells you if you left it somewhere and the exact location. Magnet stays strong on your phone case
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,I love the feel of the finewoven texture compared to its leather predecessor. I use this thing as a grip on the back of my naked iphone 15 pro. It stores cards properly and they also come out with ease when i need then. Durability is still a huge question mark long term as this is a new material for apple products. It definitely can show scratches pretty easily if you were to take your fingernail and straight up scratch it. Love the blue color as it pairs well with the new blue titanium 15 pro.
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,"The magnet is a 5 or 6 out of 10. The find my iPhone doesn‚Äôt work as one may prefer. It works as long as it‚Äôs attached to your phone. The second it‚Äôs not attached it saves as the last known location. It will also tell you that you‚Äôve left it behind. This works great if you plan to have the wallet attached 24/7. I leave mine unattached most of the time when I get home or go to work. Here‚Äôs an example, when i leave in the morning and attach my wallet it shows it‚Äôs attached. I then hop in my car in my garage in San Antonio and place it in the glove department. At that point the wallet shows it‚Äôs in San Antonio in my garage regardless of where I go. I then get to my job in Austin and reattach my wallet it now will show its connected wherever I go. I get into my office and take the wallet off and again it will show that it‚Äôs left in my office regardless of where I go."
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,"I love the mulberry color - it's a little more of a purple/plumb in person than it looks in pictures, but I personally love that! It looks beautiful with my mulberry Finewoven case. I've seen some speculation online regarding the potential durability of this material, but I tend to be pretty careful with my things and I already wouldn't touch my phone/wallet with dirty hands, so I'm not too worried. I'll update my review if I notice durability issues, but so far I'm pleased with it. The material is really soft and lovely. I'm hoping it lasts well. The reason I'm glad I went with this combo is that I really wanted the wallet with the Find My feature! So cool that I can track my wallet's last location if I did lose it (also if it were to come off of the phone, it gives you a notification that it's been removed/left behind). Another note is that the magnet is VERY strong when paired with the Finewoven case, so I don't anticipate this will accidentally pop off. When I tested it against the back of my phone without the case, it was less strong but still seemed more than capable of staying put. If I wasn't concerned that I'll break my phone by dropping it someday, I would absolutely pair this wallet with the case-less phone. It fits my credit card, debit card, and ID perfectly. When I added a fourth card, it was a tight squeeze, but still technically fit, although I ultimately opted just to go with three so I'm not struggling when it's time to pull cards in and out. Overall I'm pleased and would recommend this based on first impressions!"
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,"If you‚Äôre buying this make sure you remember that you have to prioritize which cards you‚Äôre using that day it‚Äôs really lot a replacement for a wallet but more of an add on for convenience, it is slim and has a nice profile but if you don‚Äôt have an Apple case (I have an otter box) it still slips off fairly easily.

PS: find my only works from the last location it was detached."
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,"I love Wallet! It's made my life so much easier. Instead of carrying around a bulky wallet, I just stick this thing on the back of my phone, and boom‚Äîall my cards and cash are right there when I need them.

It's more of a dark blue color rather than black. Still, it looks really good though.

Overall, I'm really impressed with this wallet. It's convenient, easy to use, and it looks good. If you're tired of lugging around a big wallet, give this thing a try. You won't regret it!"
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,Bought to replace a Apple leather wallet. Still has the issue of the sealed brim peeling away after time but feel reassured knowing the RFID blocking is there and can trust the MagSafe. I take this everywhere and like that it limits me to 3 cards (ID and 2 credit) wish the outer seals were better but this fixes the scratching on the face of the leather wallet.
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,"I got the Taupe color that was delivered yesterday. The wallet originally would not connect I somehow got it to connect after 15 minutes of restarting my phone and taking the case off.

However it would not show it the ‚ÄúFind My‚Äù app. But when I tried to re set it up it would say that it was already connected.

I ended up spending an hour on the phone with Apple Support who informed me that the fine woven taupe wallet has an issue where this happens and there was a service bulletin about that color in particular.

We were able to get it to work by turning off find my iPhone, restarting the phone, taking off the case, turning the phone back on, turning find my iPhone back on. Then putting the wallet directly to the phone (no case) and hitting the + sign and add MagSafe accessory.

I‚Äôm a little weary but seems to be working as of now."
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,"I'm probably over-exaggerating, but it's really changed the way I go about my day-to-day.

I got to the point where I was carrying a set of keys (two car key fobs, plus other keys for business and mail), a traditional wallet, and my iPhone. As you can imagine, not only were my pockets bulging, but my iPhone was getting scratching up more than my wallet was taking abuse.

While this ""wallet"" only holds three cards, I carry my driver's license, a personal credit card, and business credit card. The latter two are only b'c some gas station and restaurants don't take NFC payment. Otherwise, I'm using Apple Pay from my watch and phone. I've essentially slimmed down my traditional wallet and rely on Apple Pay now more than ever. I keep a small wad of cash ($10+/‚Äì) in my car and each of my bags just in case of emergency.

My pockets are lighter than ever. I can find this wallet if I ever lose it using Find My. And my keys now only make holes in my pockets, no more scratches on my conventional wallet or phone."
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,I chose this wallet over others because it works with the find my feature but the magnet in it is really weak and the cards are difficult to get out.
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,"It is extremely nice to touch, but it looses a star due to the staining."
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,It's a magnet and cloth. The material cost should be low
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,"I like the color , just the Magnet comes off"
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,"After a week vacation to Florida mine still looks great. More importantly, even if it doesn‚Äôt look bad or discolors after time it‚Äôs more sustainable than leather, which uses horrible chemicals and of course, cows are horrible for the ecosystem, putting off methane gas, which is seven times more destructive to our earths ozone layer . I‚Äôm not saying that this is the best product Apple can make. But it‚Äôs a good start to get away from leather. Also, overall, I‚Äôm sure Apple is not doing great with carbon omissions or chemicals from making all of their batteries, etc. But again it‚Äôs a good step in the right direction"
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,"Wallet magnetically adheres strongly to (i) iPhone without a case, (2) iPhone with an Apple case or (iii) iPhone with a TORRAS Magnetic Slim Fit case. Cases with thick backs probably don't work.

I have a car mount that magnetically adheres to back of iPhone. Still works with wallet attached to iPhone. Apple says wallet is magnetically shielded but not sure car mount won't erase magnetic strips on credit cards in wallet. Nobody uses the magnetic strips on credit card anymore.

Holds only 3 cards but it's not bulky. Micro-fiber is practical and glides well in pocket."
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,I was at first excited to get a minimalist Mag Sare wallet with FindMy Support built in(Assuming the wallet had the KeyTag functionality built in). Unfortunately the FindMy functionality only supports telling you the last place your wallet was detached. So once you detach the wallet you can no longer track it. This seems a little pointless. While I'll be switching to another magsafe wallet this wallet is very clean and simple. If it had the equivalent functionality as an airtag built-in it would be perfect.
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,"*Updated after using for a week* I previously had a leather Apple wallet with Find My, which I used daily for years! Loved it but it was so worn and falling apart. I was pleased to see that Apple released a new version of the wallet in new colors. I was interested to see how this material would hold up in comparison to the leather version. The first thing I noticed when putting this on my phone is that the MagSafe magnet isn‚Äôt as strong as the previous version. I‚Äôm using a MagSafe case, which was the same one I used with the leather Apple wallet. This one is not as secure as the leather model and has slipped off several times. The texture of this fabric material feels nice and luxurious but it scratches quite easily. I find myself being a lot more careful with this wallet vs how I could handle the leather version. I ended up returning it because it just wasn‚Äôt a reliable product."
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,"I have been a lifelong Apple fan. I usually buy the Apple leather cases for my phone and enjoy those. When I first saw the leather MagSafe wallet I didn‚Äôt purchase because I was worried about the leather stretching too much and felt it slid off the phone too easy, plus it didn‚Äôt have ‚Äúfind my‚Äù until recently.

I went ahead and wanted to give this a try. I‚Äôm greatly impressed at how light it is and how well the magnet adheres to the phone. I‚Äôm sure it would stretch but it fits 3 cards snuggly with no issues.

The material is soft and color of the blue is nice. I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs ‚Äúbetter‚Äù than the previous leather version but find the magnet working much better and is lighter.

The ‚Äúfind my‚Äù feature worked flawless and connected right away, I get notifications anytime my wallet is off my phone.

If you‚Äôre looking for a clean, simple, and light wallet, I recommend. Great accessory for travel, on the go, and minimizing what you need to carry."
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,"I have purchased two (2) of these. The black as well as the taupe. They are not leather and even though most people believe EVERYTHING they read, especially in these reviews, they were never described to be anything close to leather. They are a woven ""suede"" like material that feels and acts like suede. And yes, if you spill oil-like liquids on it, like suede, it will stain or your oily, nasty fingerprints will stain it. This is meant to be taken care of much like the woven phone cases and the $1600 phone inside of each. Apple moved away from the ""leather"" type materials for a reason and obviously the Sheeple are scared of change.
If you keep your phone, phone case, and wallet in good condition you will not have any issues and they will remain almost looking as new. Excellent quality and product as we are used to and expect."
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,"I wanted to love this but I couldn‚Äôt.
Since it loads from the top, especially with a case on and where it attached, it leads to some difficulty getting the cards out. I kept thinking I wish it was a side load instead.
The other thing was the fabric. I didn‚Äôt really care for it and I expected at least a leather like, but they seemed a little‚Ä¶ different?"
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,"Purchased this wallet used in good condition. The product was fine, however it is still linked to the original owner‚Äôs AppleID. So not only can I not add it to ‚Äúfind my‚Äù devices, but everytime I attach to my phone, a big message saying ‚Äúnot your wallet‚Äù pops up. I contacted Apple and they said the only way to fix it was to have the original owner remove the device."
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,"The green looks great with my new brown leather case and the ‚Äúfind my‚Äù function is handy, but the magnet strength is a little weaker than the original one. It sometimes knocks off. I would still recommend it, but not 5 stars for that reason."
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,"Magnet holds well. Compatible as an Apple device to share last known location is nice, but being unable to speak to current location is potentially frustrating. The pocket is slim and tight making it more reasonable for an ID and 1 card, but increasingly more challenging with more than 2 total items in the pocket. I would suggest that it cannot adequately sustain holding 4 cards securely. I am keeping it just in case due to Apple compatibility but have already switched to a non apple version that does not show location but easily expands to hold more."
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,"I purchased this MagSafe wallet so that I wouldn‚Äôt always have to carry a wallet with me. The wallet holds about 2 cards and a drivers license. You could probably add 3 cards and 1 DL, but it would be harder to remove the cards. When you take the wallet out of the package, you simply attach to your iPhone and it connects with Find My. If you leave the wallet detached for about a minute you get an alert on your devices that your wallet was detached and the location/address where it was detached.

Now for the cons: this material is terrible. Apple really needs to go back to leather or maybe a carbon fiber or hard plastic type case. On the left is a 2 year old Apple leather wallet. On the right is a fine woven material that is 6 months old. The fine woven material is even separating where the card goes. It‚Äôs like Apple took recycled garbage and put it in a wallet. There has to be a better material that can be used. Please make changes for the September 2024 iPhone 16 launch."
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,"When I first saw this wallet, I was skeptical about it. I kept thinking of reasons why it probably wouldn't be right for me. But I took the plunge anyway, because I can return it if I'm right. Well I wasn't. I love this thing. It matches and fits perfectly into place on the back of my Apple case for my iPhone, and I don't really need more than 3 cards on me at once anyway. It's very smartly designed and has that Apple premium aesthetic and feel to it. My old wallet has been retired for good."
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,"I wish Apple would have stuck with the original leather, or found a decent vegan leather alternative. This finewoven junk scratches like no-other and doesn't hold up to wear and tear at all. My previous mag-safe leather wallets show nice aging but still look and work a charm"
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,Have had the wallet for a while now. It‚Äôs nice and feels soft. I will say that it has drastically faded in color and I‚Äôm not hard on it either but overall I like it.
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,"This material is like a dream. It's so soft, it feels not like cloth but like a very soft undesirable material. However, yes, even the slightest fingernail scratches leave permanent marks. Stains from getting water on it to hand oil to just everyday use have left the wallet pretty battered and stained. It was cool while it lasted, it still works."
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,"Overall a good accessory to have have. I love the color. Only issue is the material attracts a lot of dirt. When I got it , by the second or third day, it looked like I had the wallet for months lol"
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,"I already had a magnetic wallet for my iPhone, and bought this one because it advertised that it has FindMy functionality. It doesn't really. All it does is remember where the device was when it was removed from the phone. And even then, it is ad the address granularity, you can't use that to figure out where in your house you left it. Was disappointing to me, as that was the whole reason I bought it! Also, the fabric gets dirty and is hard to clean."
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,"I choose this one specifically for Finf My, and it doesn‚Äôt connect. lame!"
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,"I picked up 2 of the black color fine woven wallets for different phones.

One worked perfectly (great attachment, Find My worked without issues). It feels like suede leather, so no complaints. The cards also feel very secure‚Ä¶ but on a ProMax, the lens projection provides additional security to prevent a card from popping out. Love this accessory.

Find My functionality never worked on the second wallet (kept getting an incompatible accessory message when trying to add it). I am returning this one and going to get a replacement. For the record, this is the first Apple product I have ever had to return because of a defect."
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,I really wanted to love this. I bought this in May and lost it in June. The wallet knocks off easily and the notifications came 20 minutes after I lost it.i used the gps to try to find it and spent several hours hours looking for where it said it was and never found it. Beware.

Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,"Mag safe wallet is excellent, it alerts you every time it‚Äôs detached tells you the location of detachment- works perfect, great for all Apple mag safe iPhones, I highly recommend this wallet it‚Äôs perfect for my needs. See review photo this is what pops up on your phone every time the wallet detaches very useful!"
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,"Absolutely love this wallet and love the fact it has ‚Äúfind my‚Äù capabilities. My phone also notifies me when the wallet is off!!! Stays in place, good magnet. If I had to pick anything that was less than perfect: it‚Äôs tight & hard (I have 3 cards in it) and I have to remove it to push them out from the back. I‚Äôm just used to the rubbery ones that I can just pull the cards out from the front."

Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,"works great, just gets dirty easily"
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,"Original: Looks great feels great, but does NOT support Find My despite what the description indicates.

Update: unlike the prior versions of MagSafe wallet where the technology seemed to be imbedded in the wallet itself, these newer FineWoven wallets rely/require iOS 17. So FindMy is supported, but only on the latest iOS.

Further update: As above, iOS 17 is a requirement. Furthermore, only shows up as a device on your phone. Does NOT act like the 2nd gen leather wallet which showed up as a 'device' throughout your ecosystem. Does not show up on your iPad or MacBook. Serious downgrade from the leather version which is probably why 2nd gen leather MagSafe wallets are selling for over original price. I'd give it a 2.5 at most."
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,"The new Apple finewoven line of wallets does not ""stick"" to the magsafe cases like my earlier Apple leather magsafe wallet (2nd gen). I purchased this new from Amazon to replace a black leather case that I gave to a family member. Immediately I noticed that the bottom magnet released very easily and with almost no effort (and I am using an Apple clear magsafe case). This has the effect of loosening the wallet from the case and, when removing from my pocket, resulted in the wallet detaching.

I took the case to my local Apple store the next day thinking I had a defective unit. The Apple rep brought three new display models for me to try on my phone and all had the same problem. The rep stated that she had noticed the same thing and thinks it is the finewoven material being the issue. Regardless of the root cause (new material, weaker magnet), this case is going back today as the magnet is too weak for my use case."

Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,I was excited to get this wallet because it is great when I cruise and don‚Äôt want to carry a purse or other bag. The problem is it EASILY detaches from the phone. I almost lost it at one point. Not a good thing since anything you would put in the wallet would be very inconvenient if lost.
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,"It does exactly what I want it to do. Stays on my mag-safe phone case and holds three cards easily. Keeping cash in it is a little annoying as its hard to get out, but overall it works great."
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,This is the absolute best wallet / material!!! I love apple fine woven!!!!!
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,"The wallet is very different and stands out for its unique color. Texture is fantastic, its magnetic inside works fantastically and is slick when attached to a phone. Enough room for 3 cards which is more than enough for me.
However, I hope if it ever gets lost, the find my works well like it is working now.
Great purchase PERIOD!"
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,It is very disappointing that this wallet will not connect with my iPhone 12 Find My capability.
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,"This wallet is absolutely beautiful! It looks amazing on my iPhone 15 Pro. It holds 3 cards, which is enough for me. Having the wallet is so convenient and much easier than carrying a big wallet with me. I love the Taupe color; it is a neutral color that goes with most iPhone colors and cases. You will love it!"
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,Excellent seller. Would do business again.
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,"As someone who has lost their wallet more than once, this is a great product. It‚Äôs light weight and the magnet is strong enough to stay on my magnetic dash holder."
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,Super functional and shows the location in Find My devices. Pretty neat tech from Apple!
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,This material feels cheap in comparison to the leather of previous products. I‚Äôll keep it since I need a wallet and I like the MagSafe and Find My feature.
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,After only using for a week the material is falling apart. Good magnetic connection to phone but experience with quality not as good as expected.

Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,"This wallet is very convenient! I'm cashless, so I usually only need my credit card and ID. This wallet makes it so easy to bring those items with me. The woven material is high quality, and I can see this lasting a while."
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,I‚Äôve been using my Apple Wallet for about 3 weeks now and I absolutely love it. Only holds 3 cards so if you‚Äôre good with that you won‚Äôt be disappointed.

Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,You most likely don‚Äôt need it. Its is useful but its features are gimmicks
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,"The magnet seems to be strong enough, but it‚Äôs very stiff, which makes it very difficult to remove cards once you put them in. You almost need tweezers to get cards out. Not sure I‚Äôll really use it."
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,"I just want to start by saying that I truly am a very loyal Apple fan. I never hesitate to spend the extra money for Apple brand products. That being said, I was so excited to receive this new MagSafe wallet to use with my pink iPhone 15. I have had the black leather MagSafe wallet for over a year but maroon is my favorite color so I wanted to love this new wallet. IT IS HORRIBLE. This new fine woven material is horrific. I have no idea why Apple would have discontinued the leather option (make it vegan leather!!!) and I have no idea how in the world Apple approved the sale of this item that is so clearly lacking in quality. I am so glad I didn‚Äôt get the matching phone case.

These photos are after about three weeks of use. I take such good care of my things and sit at a desk all day‚Ä¶ I swear I am not a dirty person, yet this is what the wallet is left looking like. I am so disappointed in Apple. I really wanted to like this wallet, mostly because of its Find My capability. Unfortunately I missed the return window so I‚Äôm stuck with it.

From someone who will always tell you to get the Apple product‚Ä¶. DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THIS."
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,Todo muy bien gracias.
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,"This one is Dorset work but I goes to Apple Store and they change it to me without any problem.
I definitely recommend this wallet."
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,"For a hard disk of this caliber and price, they could have at least added a 1ft Thunderbolt cable, instead of the current 6-inch length."
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,"This is what it looks like after 30 days of normal use.

I think it kinda looks cool, got that aged, raggedy, worn look.

However the magnet is weak (compared to the leather iteration) and it's really heavy for what it is.

I have the 2nd generation leather one (with find my), and the quality is night and day. They are both premium, Apple quality feel. But it's just that fine woven material itself really cheapens this thing. I'd buy for maybe $20."
Apple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe - Taupe,46,"The magnet isn‚Äôt that strong. Good thing it has a disconnected notification, bc one small drop and that thing is flying off."
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,"I hate cases. Love to go comando with my phones because the design is so beautiful. But sometimes you need protection when going rough üòèüòÇ
This is the best transparent case hands down, because it will NEVER gonna go yellow or cloudy.

I have tried top brands, more expensive cases, but every one gets yellow with time. Apple‚Äôs don‚Äôt.

I have try to avoid transparent cases for this reason, just a fee months of good looking and then the yellowing makes it look cheap and ugly. Not Apple‚Äôs.

Make yourself a favor. Get this one!"
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,"I bought this as an open-box item but it was perfectly brand new, with no flaws whatsoever. I bought it for half the price of a new case. The texture and grip this phone case has beats any other case out there for the iPhone, in my opinion. I bought the Evergreen color for this case. Apple does it right with their silicone cases, it‚Äôs hard to think there‚Äôs any better than this case out there, so you can‚Äôt go wrong."
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,So far so good. But its only been a couple of weeks. I'm used to a Defender system because I'm hard on phones. But trying new things and a new Os. I'll let you know if my phone breaks.
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,No slippage with a slim profile. Its protective borders around the screen are roughly 1mm to 1.5mm. Enjoy to protector the screen from face down drops without being a hindrance to single handed grasping. The raised edge surround the camera lens are perfectly fitted just above the camera as not impede taking photos or videos in any way but still protective enough to prevent scratches/cracks. Pretty pleased so far. Smokey grey color looks great against the black titanium iPhone colorway.
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,"To each their own, but I personally don't understand where the hate comes from with these cases. I haven't had it for too long, but most of the complaints I see here have to do with the feel, which I happen to like a lot. I've owned Apple's leather and silicone cases before, and I actually prefer the feel of this one over both of those. The back of the case with the finewoven material is suede-like to the touch, while the sides are grippy and feel pretty thick. The whole case feels quite sturdy and luxe in the hand. It also has much less give to it than Apple's silicone cases do, and feels generally thicker overall to me than their leather cases did. Since the finewoven backing is technically made of fabric, I can see how I could get stained easily by spills, lotions, etc., but a little soap and water would remediate this."
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,Case fits perfectly & the clay color goes amazing with the natural titanium 15 pro max. Buttons are clicky and responsive. MagSafe magnet is strong and responsive. I have no idea why these cases get so much hate‚Ä¶ they look great and perform!
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,The case is nice and fits the phone perfect. The only problem was the buttons are too hard and you need to press very hard. I had to returned it for that reason.
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,"Its a nice case, one of my favorite ones I have owned. I take really good care of my phone/case but not even a year later I had a small nic on the case that eventually started spreading and the silicone started to peel off quite rapidly and it was simply from pulling the phone in and our of my pocket.

Good at first, but did not hold up for even a year, and for the price that kind of sucks."
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,"Quality is very good ,colour super English but little slippery from hand"
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,I drop my phone all the time and this one has not even made a scratch it‚Äôs feels nice in your hands and the color stays clean the buttons aren‚Äôt hard to push either ease of use is amazing and the clarity is also amzong
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,"With all the bad reviews and hate this case has gotten online, I waited for a bit but eventually knew I had to try it out for myself so i got the Pacific Blue version. The color is a little darker than I was expecting but still really nice. I think this case is a good substitute for the leather case as it feels premium to me, i like the soft material on the back and the side material is also great, it feels nice and is very comfortable to hold onto. The buttons are perfect, of course, as you would expect from an apple case. As far as durability, I have had this case for about 6 weeks and it is holding up quite well. There is a slight impression from the MagSafe charger, which is expected and the fine woven material looks a bit worn but not bad at all and not a single scratch to be seen. Maybe I do tend to baby my phone whether there is a case or not so that no doubt has something to do with it. I like how slim it is and it feels completely natural on the phone to where it almost seems like an extension of it instead of something surrounding it like a plastic case often feels (to me anyway). I also got it on sale, not a huge savings but it made it seem worth it to me. I‚Äôm even tempted to get another one in a different color because I had a hard time deciding which one to go for‚Ä¶Personally, I like this better than the leather cases just because the leather always felt sticky to me after a couple of days of use and this one still feels nice after only 6 weeks. Time will tell if it continues to perform at the level it has so far. It does also attract dust occasionally, but it wipes off easily enough so its not rally an issue. I recommend this case as long as you are like me and are extremely cautious with your iPhone anyway as it is a slim case and will provide only limited protection if dropped. Still, very happy with this case!"
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,I fell in love with the apple cases and struggled to find the yellow one for my phone in stores. I finally did on here and love it so much! Went right on and fits well with the camera protectors.
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,"More like grey than brown IMO, and it works great with titanium blue, you might as well check at Apple store in person before making purchase decision."
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,"Apple quality silicone case, love the color. Good protection for phone however I do take care of my phone. It will stick in your pockets because of the silicone, I consider that added protection against the phone accidentally falling out of a pocket but sometimes."
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,"Adorable color, Apple product so you know it does the job and is sleek and attractive. I have two of these cases in different colors for different occasions. Got it on Amazon cheaper than Apple directly which is always great!"
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,when dropped rubber does split but it‚Äôs a case for a reason

Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,Case has held up well. Easy to hold. Minimalistic. high quality. Not much to really say!
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,"There is a review saying it‚Äôs fake because there is no animation, but the silicone cases do not show animation when you‚Äôre on your Home Screen. When I put it on and my phone was off and I got the animation and they do make a sound tho if your ringer is on. This is def authentic and such good quality I love the color too!!"
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,I love Apple silicone cases
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,"Excellent fit, Good quality I would definitely recommend this"
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,Love how it feels
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,The case feels great in the hand but it wont hold that softness for long. I also bought it used from the Amazon Warehouse but it came with the silicon peeling off so that was disappointing as well.

Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,Great color. Simple. And protects my phone.
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,"Great feel, great color."
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,"Before I load my gripes with this product I would like to say it is a very clean and appealing case. I do however, have a couple of concerns with the quality of the case but it is to be expected when you‚Äôre paying for the brand rather than quality. I dropped this phone case from about knee height onto my hardwood floor and I came to realized that it split where it had fallen. Outside on rocks would have made sense to me but hardwood floors do not strike me as something that could split the silicone like that. The case itself is smooth enough to feel nice in the hands but offers enough grip to still sit firmly in your palm. It isn‚Äôt like cheaper silicone case where they are either sliding on any surface or sticking to any surface. Overall the case looks nice, I am a little disappointed about the durability but it does cover the entirety of the phone well. It does not add much weight or bulk to the phone either."
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,This thing slipped out of my hand while literally taking it out of its packaging. The phone is surprisingly difficult to manage when you're constantly worried about dropping it. Sent it back immediately.
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,This is the second MagSafe clear case I have purchased from Amazon (First was for 13 Pro Max and now for the 15 Pro Max) during the Black Friday sales. Each one has had a rainbow effect between the phone and protector that drives me crazy. Really thought it would be different this time around but I guess it is just par for the course with these clear cases. I really like the MagSafe image on the back and the main reason I keep purchasing. Don't think I will for any new devices I upgrade to. I have learned my lesson. It is slippery to hold as others have stated and can crack when removing from phone. Thankfully I also purchased an Apple Silicone case at sale price because the clear one quickly came off and stored back in the box.
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,"This phone case is very cute! I like the color and feel! However, I have only had it for a month and it already is peeling and chipping."
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,"This case is great. It looks and feels super premium, and I don't think there's anything I'd change."
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,"when i first bought this case i was sent a dirty case meant for another phone in the same packaging, not sure why, so be aware of that. (the reason for the -1 star) but amazon quickly fixed the mistake and 5 days later i had the right case. i agree with some of the reviews that this case is slippery when i first put this case on my phone i was worried i would drop it, its almost silky? if that makes sense. but after having it for 2 weeks on my phone it doesnt slip out of my hand and i like the aesthetic. it does add a bit of weight. i havent tested the magsafe yet as i bought it for an option not necessity."
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,great color. Love it!
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,"I have gotten apple leather cases every year for the last 5+ years‚Ä¶. so I was a bit sad to see it go this year.

Being that Apple knows they had to put out a good replacement, I was hopeful this would be a good replacement. Unfortunately, it is not.

Overall it doesn‚Äôt have the same premium look and feel. The fabric is very thin and slippery, but a bit rough at the same time. It‚Äôs hard to explain but the feel of the case is just a miss.

And there‚Äôs the durability concerns.. The fabric has been shown to scratch and stain very easily. Questionable design decisions here from apple. The sides of the case is actually the best part. They did seem to make the sides more durable but if it were to ever rip, it would look very badly.

Overall, the case falls far short of its predecessor.

The leather case got better with age ‚Ä¶. this case will become a mess very quickly if you‚Äôre not very easy on your phone. Keys in a pocket with this case or just throwing it in a pocketbook would not end well.

Update: I used the case for 5 days and have noticed a ring around the MagSafe area from just a few mag safe charges, a random stain by the power button , several visible scratches and decided it‚Äôs not the case for me.

For the price, it‚Äôs not worth it. If the case was $30-40 I‚Äôd keep it for random occasions where I wanted a classy blue case lol . What a bummer üëé"
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,This is a great case made by Apple. The silicone is grippy and very nice to hold in my hands. Plus it has withstood months of use and it hasn't broken at all. The bump covering the cameras is just the right height that it will protect them if dropped. Although I will have to admit I had a similar silicone case for my iPhone 13 and with about a year or so of use the case started to fall apart from being dropped a few times. While this hasn't happened yet to me specifically with this case I did have to buy another one for my iPhone 13. So just keep that in mind if you ware looking for a case that will last you forever unfortunately this isn't the one you want. But I would say that it is worth the money and I really enjoy the bright colors to help my phone stand out from the rest.
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,"Storm blue - This case is buttery smooth, and though the grip was a little slippery at first, it‚Äôs getting better with time. I really like how the bottom is designed also -it‚Äôs super soft and there are no sharp cut outs to aggravate your pinky while holding the phone. The fit is perfect and the phone snaps right into place. I can‚Äôt speak for its ability to protect, though the edges are slightly raised and it seems protective for a slender design. Love the stormy blue color also - very sleek on my black titanium 15 PM.
PS. I will add that I also purchased the color in Cypress. The color ended up being way darker in person than how it appeared online. Still a great color IMO, but I did end up returning it and sticking with the blue."
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,Just received my case and was very disappointed that the case was such a dark green that it appears black.
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,The case looks amazing - but is loose and creaks as I use my phone. There is a lot of play around the bottom corners.
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,Buying an apple product was important to my child for her phone case. Within a week the case had a tear in it at the top of the case. It was not very durable. The case is pretty but do not take the case off and on. It seems like it might tear again. Would not recommend.
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,"Fits good, allows charging."
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,"I like the feel of the material and how well the case protects my phone. This might be my favorite iPhone case from Apple so far. I love the dark green color, and I'd def try different colors next time."
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,It is ok with no outstanding qualities. There is other choices of vendor other than Apple which could be cheaper or more expensive.
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,"The silicone case is not built to last. While I like the touch, I have to replace the case 1-2 times during a one year ownership cycle. Highly annoying for such an expensive case."
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,I am so very happy with this case. It fits my iPhone 15 pro max perfectly. It is soft to the touch but durable. Works great with my MagSafe charger. I liked it so much I also purchased it in blue as well.
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,"I‚Äôve used this case for all of my Apple iPhones. I had this exact case on for about 7 months, and then I dropped my phone on the sidewalk. Thankfully, my phone was 100% in tact, and the case chipped just in the corner. Although the case chipped, it saved my phone from any damage."
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,It worked great but big drops will chip the case i knew that buying it so thats my fault but if youre just looking for a pretty color case then yeah its perfectüòÇ
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,"This case I have had for a few months now and I miss the old leather cases, it was between this one and Nomad and Bullstrap and I chose this one first and it wore horribly replaced within 3 months! Look else where for your case."
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,Fits great. Couldn't find it at the Apple Store so the was amazing.
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,"Love the light blue color,feels comfortable in hands. Good grip and it saves your phone from accidents like hitting the floor!"
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,It looks more navy blue than black
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,"When it comes down to it, you know what you will get from a company like Apple! And even the silicone cases are no different. I have tried many other silicone cases and non even come close to how Apple‚Äôs feel and look. They feel so soft and silky, and look so nice and so damn expensive! Lol! And honestly they are kinda expensive so that is true.
You need to take care of it as you would your iPhone. Just cause it‚Äôs a case doesn‚Äôt mean you can be rough and it will stay looking good. Everyone says look at this my case is peeling and scratched. But do they tell you how it got that way? Maybe by being rough and no caring too much about it. You take care of it and it will take care of you!
Protection wise, it‚Äôs not gonna be great for that! If you want protection then go with a company that makes protective cases! If you want something that looks just as good as your iPhone then go with this case! You won‚Äôt be disappointed!"
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,"I got used to getting the leather apple cases every time I would get a new phone and when they stopped making them I was bummed. I had no interest in the cloth ones they replaced the leather with. This case is really nice to the touch and has good grip, my only real worry is staining the silicone but so far it has held up good to all kinds of stuff with no noticeable stains or damage."
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,have a nice life
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,Great phone case! But with in a couple months it has started to peel on the bottom not a lot but has peeled just a little.
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,"The color is mice, but the case it's self did not really protect the phone well."
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,"This is another excellent Apple product. I have had several of the Apple Silicon cases, and I think they are just about the best, particularly for magnet strength and protection. I have only had the case for about a week or so but unfortunately have already dropped the phone three times, the amount of the drop was about 2 to 4 feet each time and the case protected the phone perfectly. No scratches no breaks no cracks anywhere on the phone due to the stability and the sturdiness of the case. The color of the case is exactly as in the picture, and this green is one of my favorites. I do have to say that when the iPhone 15 was released, I also bought one of their new cases that replaced the leather. If you have read the reviews on that case, you will understand why it had to be returned to Apple. It was very flimsy, construction and easily showed all marks and scratches , so stick with the hard or the silicone cases and you will do fine. This case has no problems with the magnet, and is very smooth to the touch as all silicone is."
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,"Fits perfectly, doesn‚Äôt scratch the iPhone, has small bump to protect front glass too.
And easy to clean when used for some time."

Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,"This silicone case was an absolute steal. I bought it used on here and there are no blemishes or issues with it. And I‚Äôm pretty sure it was half the normal price. This is the way! If you haven‚Äôt used one of these cases before, they are very high quality and fit like a glove on your iPhone. It‚Äôs an Apple product for an Apple product. It makes a lot of sense. The MagSafe is fully compatible as you‚Äôd think and the camera lens on my Pro Max is protected. Love it!!"
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,"I really wanted to like this phone case by Apple. I‚Äôm a little sore they did away with the leather option as that was my preferred case. This fine woven material felt slick in my hands, that might be because it‚Äôs winter and I work in construction, along with constant hand washing my hands are on the dry side. Even the plastic edges are slick. I bought a used case in a ‚Äúlike new‚Äù state, yet there was a spot on the back that I could live with, but I just couldn‚Äôt get over how slick it felt in my hands or how brittle the material felt. I will be using the Apple silicon alternative as that one feels a lot more grippier and I believe it to take an impact better."
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,"Not saying you‚Äôre wrong if you don‚Äôt like this case, but the massive hate it has received has been ridiculously overblown. I suspect some people are just upset that it‚Äôs not leather or a leather substitute, which I can understand. Apple‚Äôs leather products were very good. But at the scale at which they operate, it makes sense as an environmental thing. Leather is made of cows. This stuff is made of plants. I think it feels nice. The scratches it shows fade over a day or two. See if you like how it feels."
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,"This is my all time favorite case !! I‚Äôve had iphones for 12 years and nothing comes close to the elegance of this phone case!!! Yes it gets dirty , but clean it with a small amount of laundry detergent and some warm water , and it‚Äôll look like new!"
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,"It's expensive for what it is, but it's easy to grab (not slippery) and maintains the low profile of the phone. I.e. doesn't add much thickness.

I used to drop my iPhone 14 in a hard clear plastic case all the time, but haven't even had a close call with this case. Nice that there isn't a big ugly mag-safe ring on the back. Makes the look of the phone much more elegant. Still works great with mag safe chargers though.

Just wish it wasn't so expensive."
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,"First thing‚Äôs first: this case won‚Äôt dry your hands out. I‚Äôve used silicone cases in the past that would leave my hands dried and pruny, but this one hasn‚Äôt yet. The material is extremely grippy, which is great while walking around or using the device in risky places (but makes sliding the phone into my jeans pocket a bit of a challenge). I have the Natural Titanium device, and the Clay color works extremely well with the camera hump‚Äôs color. In typical Apple fashion, it‚Äôs more expensive than a silicone case you could find from competitors, but also in typical Apple fashion it‚Äôs extremely well made and has an aesthetic design."
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,"Serves its purpose, holds up well, excellent quality."
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,Excellent
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,"Honestly, so many people are hating on these fine woven cases, but the taupe looks soooo good with the natural titanium.

I think the biggest concern is the case staining easily, so you really have to be careful with it while eating. I was able to wipe off some small blemishes with a microfiber cloth and cool water.

I gave this four stars because I worry about the durability of the case, which is a problem considering the expensive price point."
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,It‚Äôs very nice but I asked for a 15+ not a 15 Pro Max
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,I like Apple Silicone cases however I was a little disappoint because the color is much more muted than in the picture. I was expecting a sky blue type of color and its more like a sky blue with grey mixed in. Im gonna keep it though.
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,Great fit and loved the color. Durable and great value for your money. Will definitely purchase again.
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,I have had many iPhone cases over the years. One thing that bothers me is how quickly one can be dinged or scratched and that mark is left there forever and a day. Instant aging. This case hasn‚Äôt done that and I‚Äôve had it for a month or so now. Yippidy doo dah.
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,Best phone case I‚Äôve ever owned. So cute and protective
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,"very pleased with this case, i had the black woven one for the last year and decided to get the forest green color. Its a gorgeous deep green color. I cant understand all the negative reviews, it really gorgeous!"
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,Love this case. Feels very nice in the hand. Great color.
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,"This means if you‚Äôre the kind of person that touches your phone while your hands are oily, greasy, or visibly dirty, then you can expect the case to become stained very quickly. If you‚Äôre the type to just toss your phone into your bag with whatever else is in there, then yeah the case will get scratches. It‚Äôs a no brainer. However, from the standpoint of grip, aesthetics, and the security of your magsafe wallet in terms of it slipping off the phone (especially if you use the swede-like Apple wallets), this is by far Apple‚Äôs best case to date, period!"
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,"There is not a lot to say about this, its an Apple designed Silicone case made for the 15 Pro Max. Has mag safe in the case so that you can easily charge and use accessories. I have had it since launch, and I never drop my phone, but the case has a small tear in the silicone, not enough to expose the iphone, but it was weird to see. After a while the case does get oily feeling, so was a bit weird to get used to holding the silicone case. Definitely does the job, the camera ring is high enough for camera protection, has a lip around the edge for screen protection, if you love apple products then this is a fine case to get for your iphone."
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,Top reasons I bought; case allows your finger to flip up right from the bottom because there is no lip on the middle bottom. Great slim case and plastic quality. Bottom negative details that should not occur are; too hard to push buttons (!) and Slippery case.
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,"The Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe in Guava is a delight in terms of color‚Äîtruly eye-catching. Its grip is fantastic, offering a secure hold that's reassuring, especially for a larger phone.

Protection-wise, it does a commendable job, safeguarding the phone from everyday bumps and knocks. However, it's worth noting that the case itself can get nicked quite easily when dropped, which can affect its appearance.

Despite the minor wear, I still appreciate this case for its aesthetics and functionality. If you prioritize style and grip but don't mind a bit of wear over time, this case could be an excellent choice for your iPhone 15 Pro Max."
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,The only thing you need to know is if you have an I Phone buy the Apple case not the off brands. This case might cost more but it is for sure to be perfect.
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,"I will admit I was extremely apprehensive about buying this case. All the reviewers and I-sheep claim it‚Äôs a giant fail. Case was delivered today and I am so glad I bought it. It fits like a glove and while it doesn‚Äôt replace the apple leather case as my favorite, it‚Äôs light years ahead of the $50 silicone case.

The material is soft and feels great in the hand, the case is slim and wraps around the iPhone like a glove. I can see what all the durability fuss is about, but I also think it may be a little on the dramatic side. I suspect this case will wear in and provide a really nice used feel, not a patina like the leather, but more like a broken in wallet.

Just buy it! You can always return it and buy some off brand case if you do not like it."
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,"I got this for my wife's new iphone 15 pro max. Great fit and it seems sturdy, but the material seems very slick. My wife foresees it slipping out of her hand easily. Guess we will find out the durability soon!"
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,"Since I just purchased this a few weeks ago the durability question can‚Äôt be answered yet,Color is a light grey not beige or tan,I like the grip as it is smooth and easily held,I don‚Äôt like that it should get marks from water but,it does look nice after you use a microfiber cloth to touch it up.Price is high for sure but better than worrying about dropping your new IPhone."
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,"Slippery especially when fresh out of the box but it‚Äôs sleek and fits the phone like a glove. There is already a small chip on the ridge by the camera, but not noticeable. Definitely is more high quality than other clear cases i have had."
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,"Reading the prior reviews is the reason I didn‚Äôt purchase this right away. However, after going to my AT&T store to look at one and yes they are not leather and in my opinion look and feel much better than the cases of the past. It‚Äôs not falling apart, not ‚Äúripping‚Äù it looks like the typical Apple product one would be used to. Yes If you use it as a hockey puck sliding it across the ground it will wear down because it is a woven material. Will it offer as much protection as many other heavy cases, no. However most Apple cases don‚Äôt. If you spent quite a bit on your 15 Max and, like myself, want the authentic Apple accessories this is it. They look like the quality you‚Äôre used to and fit better than most Apple cases."
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,This case is nice to me day to day it meets my preference. I love the way it feels in my hand n how the case also compliments my phone. I have the natural titanium iPhone15 n bought the clay case for it n it looks gorgeous!
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,"For an Apple product, I am shocked at how cheap and non-protective this case is.
I have dropped the phone a few times since I got it in March, and it cracked the screen protector that was on it the first time it fell. It also ""scars"" easily and shows every fall. I have had it on my phone a little over 2 months now, and came on Amazon to replace it, and decided I should also write a review.

If you are a person who never drops your phone, and want something slim, this case is probably fine. It does have decent grip on it. But if you plan on ever dropping it, I would pick something else."
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,This is a very good case. Of course it‚Äôs not as sturdy as the Apple leather case but it does its job. I‚Äôve used it for over 3 months now and no complaints.
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,"I‚Äôve always had my phone in some kind of case. The decision is difficult sometimes. Thus time I decided to go with the clear case fro Apple. As I also have a wireless charging system, I wanted to make sure that the case I purchased supported this as well. Let me tell you, this case GRABS the wireless charger and it works perfectly! The clear material also shows off the phone. The only comment I would make is the buttons on the case are a little hard to press. Perhaps when it ages some it will get easier‚Ä¶then again I don‚Äôt really have to worry about accidentally pushing buttons when I pick up the phone."
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,"Best clear case out there for iPhone hands down. Doesn‚Äôt yellow, fits perfect. A bit slippery tho"
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,Don‚Äôt waste your money for the apple logo. It is very cheap material. It‚Äôs been only 9 weeks since this was delivered to me and it‚Äôs already falling apart. I don‚Äôt work or pas time on humid or strong weather or temperatures sooo‚Ä¶ it did fall once or twice but it was definitely not for tearing‚Ä¶ for a FIFTY DOLLARS PRICE‚Ä¶ I TRULY deserve something better than this. Oh and ‚Äúapple support‚Äù is a joke. üôÇ bye.
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,The volume buttons didn't fit well and my volume turn down all the time. It took some days using the case until finally fit In the right place and buttons starter to work normally
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,"i‚Äôve dropped my new phone a few times, and this case seems to hold up fairly well. It does get dirty around the edges, but a Q-tip can fix that. Overall, I‚Äôm pleased with my purchase."
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,"Previously i tried couple of different brands and this works the best for my iPhones so i buy these for yrs now.
I like the silicone grip, and variety of colors.
The only con is that they would not last for more than a year, the edges are losing the silicone and get shiny. I had a good deal on this color, it was cheaper than at the store so i am very happy with my purchase overall."
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,This is my favorite case for all of my Apple phones. Shipping was fast and my 15 slid right in. Couldn't be happier with the price
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,"Ordered the Evergreen color, but it is definitely more black than green. I don‚Äôt see any hints of green in the color. Fits well and works with all of my MagSafe accessories which is a plus."
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,"There are much better cases out there for the money. That said, it is totally ok."
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,The case is very expensive and the side buttons very hard to press down making purchases with the double-click difficult. The smooth plastic feels slippery.
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,It feels so great. Haven‚Äôt gotten my iPhone 15 Pro Max yet but this was on sale so I had to get it. Everything about it feels great. That‚Äôs why I buy apple products. Amazing! Buy while on sale if possible!
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Silicone Case with MagSafe - Orange Sorbet,28,Love this case and color! Great protection! Works great with my MagSafe charger! Perfect fit!
"Apple iPhone SE (2nd Generation), US Version, 64GB, White - Unlocked (Renewed)",Price not found,"This phone looked great, charged up great. It hold a charge pretty well, for an older iphone.
I did spend sometime talking to Amazon customer service because the phone did not come with an IMEI number printed anywhere on the box or the paperwork. Our carrier, in order to determine if the phone was suitable needed this number. I was given a method to do that, by Amazon customer service but could not get the IMEI number. The person that I spoke with from Amazon was amazing and very helpful, and really tried to get me the IMEI number from the 3rd party seller. I believe that never happened.
From some of the reviews of this phone I was lead to believe that this phone came equipped with the eSim capability-- which was not so.
I talked to my carrier who told me to swap the Sim from the old phone (Android) into the new iphone. Cracked the Android's case and found the Sim card was too big and thick to fit into the iphone. I then ordered a Sim card from my carrier--(3 days wait) . The Android (really old) phone would not download the Move to IOS app. With the new sim, I got it going, and have manually repopulated the apps I was using.
It is working great now. My thanks to all the great efforts of Amazon customer service!
My lesson learned: don't let your Android phone get too old.
Maybe the 3rd Party seller lesson learned: include the IMEI number printed somewhere!"
"Apple iPhone SE (2nd Generation), US Version, 64GB, White - Unlocked (Renewed)",Price not found,"I was very uncertain about purchasing a refurbished phone, but found myself needing to replace my phone quickly and it has been a really expensive month (water heater went out, needed some emergency dental work, and just purchased a new car) so was not looking forward to spending hundreds of dollars on a new phone unexpectedly. After reading product reviews, seller reviews and what the warranty was, I took the plunge and ordered a ‚Äòpremium‚Äô grade phone. I have had the phone for a week now and could not be happier! The phone arrived on schedule, and looked brand new cosmetically - not a scratch on it! Mechanically it works perfectly, battery capacity was like 95%, and it charges quickly and holds a charge. Looks and acts like a brand new phone for half the price. I say, go for it!"
"Apple iPhone SE (2nd Generation), US Version, 64GB, White - Unlocked (Renewed)",Price not found,"I purchased this phone for emergency needs. I purchased it in ""good"" condition. To my surprise, there aren't any scratches or marks. It's practically in brand new condition. Now, I've never owned an iphone. So from what I can tell - it works smoothly and perfectly.

No lag, no screen damage, etc. I just got this phone today, so after a few uses - I'll update. As in battery life with normal usage.

Another plus was that it actually came with a wall charger! (The block for the outlet + the wire). So that was pretty neat.

** Though judging off reviews depending on what ACTUAL seller you purchase it from it may vary in experience.

Overall satisfied."
"Apple iPhone SE (2nd Generation), US Version, 64GB, White - Unlocked (Renewed)",Price not found,"I ordered one refurbished SE phone only to have it get really fritzy. The screen touching was wonky. To the point that within a few days, it seemed the phone had been hacked. Whatever it was, we wiped it clean, returned (easily and accepted) and I ordered another - this time of the premium quality option.

The SE phone is fine, looks fine, but this one seems to have a small volume problem. Taking photos, it sounds (click noise effect). Turning off ringer, sliding volume, etc do not help. It makes the click sound.

However, have not noticed an issue with silenced calls though and am tired of trying new phones, so we think we can keep it and everything else seems to be reliable. Disappointing when taking a chance yet still spending a large amount of money. But ‚Ä¶. Ok ‚Ä¶ enough ‚Ä¶.

The rest of the iPhone SE seems working and we are iPhone users through and through. This purchase was to upgrade a (3 yr old and still working very well) SE in it‚Äôs memory capacity. We have also had iPhone 6s, 11, 12, 15‚Äôs in the last few years. So we like iPhones ‚Ä¶. Just wish a ‚Äúrefurbished like new‚Äù (or I wanted to believe that‚Äôs what refurbished meant it was indicating)‚Ä¶ wish it actually worked full on. But then again, it‚Äôs not new either. And if it‚Äôs working, the price is really a good deal less than many out there (unless you want a ‚Äúfree/discount when you sign up for a $60+ monthly service.‚Äù There are some other great iPhone - new iPhone- deals out there. I just didn‚Äôt want to upgrade from the $28 monthly service on the phone to $60.

Oh yeah. So phone came unlocked to carrier and accepted the small sim card transfer and set up immediately and easily.

So again. Satisfied ‚Ä¶ enough ‚Ä¶ as a hold over ‚Ä¶ til a later iPhone (new) upgrade."

I brought it into an Apple store, and they confirmed that the IMEI history and other aspects are good. The battery, however, was draining super fast with fairly light use. But Hybrid IT was willing to make it right in terms of an item swap or replacement for a new battery.

"Apple iPhone SE (2nd Generation), US Version, 64GB, White - Unlocked (Renewed)",Price not found,"I want to quickly apologize to the seller because I misunderstood what was happening. We took the phone to a Verizon satellite store to get it activated, and they told us that it was not a Verizon phone. Did it belong to T-Mobile? This, of course, made me really angry, and I felt like I had been cheated, so I lashed out with a bad review.

I reached out to contact the seller, and they assured me that it was a Verizon phone and that I would have no issues. I skeptically called Verizon online, and within a few moments, they were able to get the phone set up and activated and working great.
The seller was extremely prompt in communicating with me, responding within 30 minutes I think of my original message and was patient when I kept telling them that they were wrong, when I was wrong.

I'm very happy with the new phone. It looks wonderful, it functions well, and I suggest that you buy a phone from the seller because if there are any issues they will help you out immediately.

Original Review - ""The phone shipped quickly, but when we took it to the Verizon store, they said it was not a Verizon phone, but was T-Mobile. Now we will have to go through a return process for no reason."""
"Apple iPhone SE (2nd Generation), US Version, 64GB, White - Unlocked (Renewed)",Price not found,"I got mine from MOBILESUPPLY in Excellent Condition.

This is more of a review of the seller than the phone itself, as I find that a review on the seller would be more helpful for those interested in purchasing it refurbished.

TLDR: Very happy with the product but I had a few problems to actually receiving what I wanted.

Firstly, the cons.
There were many many pros and a few cons with the seller and product. The product that was originally sent out to me had a broken microphone for video recording. The battery health was at 81% (not terrible because Amazon guarantees a 80 or higher, so it wasn‚Äôt super bad but just wasn‚Äôt ideal). There were very minute scuffs to the top of the phone but nothing bad, more like you can tell someone might‚Äôve lightly brushed the phone along a wooden table and slid it or something. The main complaint was that the product was faulty. So I sent it back.

Secondly, the pros.
MOBILESUPPLY was fast with replying, regardless of the time. They were fast and helpful with the process. A few days after I shipped the phone, they received it and shipped it to me the next day. The phone right now has a few scuffs but again, nothing too bad, you‚Äôd have to look at the phone from very specific lightings and angles to see the very SMALL and light scuffs. The phone came in damn near perfect condition, with a 99% battery health! Super excited to shoot many cool videos with my new SE. Very happy, not a perfect 5 because of the first mishap but I‚Äôm very happy with the end product."
"Apple iPhone SE (2nd Generation), US Version, 64GB, White - Unlocked (Renewed)",Price not found,"LIKES: Delivered promptly and was easy to activate and transfer data quickly. Everything seems to work well and appears to be in excellent condition.

DISLIKES: The listing stated, ""Tested battery health and guaranteed to have a minimum battery capacity of 80%"". After activating and charging to full charge, I checked the battery capacity and it was only 75%. I don't know if this will be a problem, but one of the reasons I upgraded was because the battery seemed to lose its charge quicker than I thought it should. My old phone showed a battery capacity of 72%, so I hope I won't still have the same problem.

OVERALL: I don't really want to send it back and try to get another one and go thru all the hassle, but I think they should start actually testing the batteries before they ship a phone."
"Apple iPhone SE (2nd Generation), US Version, 64GB, White - Unlocked (Renewed)",Price not found,"At the moment, iPhone SE series has 3 iterations of this line: 1st generation (2016 release) , 2nd generation ( 2020 release) and 3rd generation (2022 release)

One of our family member was looking for an economical iPhone with a similar price range as many Android devices. The iPhone SE seemed to fit that category of midrange, semi budget friendly. This 2nd generation iPhone SE was in the low $400 range, brand new. Waited a few years for the price to drop as other new iPhones were released. With the added bonus of ordering through Amazon renewed program, it further decreased the cost, at least 50%+ of the original cost.

iPhone 2nd Generation is effectively based on iPhone 8 design great for those looking to upgrade from iPhone 8 or older phones.

Quality of the phone when received: physically the phone looked in great condition, didn‚Äôt detect any scratches. Worked & functioned normally, good battery health, 89%, fits the need of taking pictures & videos as well as internet access.

In summary, a good value low cost and still decent quality phone for basic purposes."
"Apple iPhone SE (2nd Generation), US Version, 64GB, White - Unlocked (Renewed)",Price not found,"The phone in appearance is in very good condition with only a minor dent on bottom right corner. As of now after just a couple days of use, everything seems to function as it should. The one demerit I will give is that the ""Renewed"" designation states it should have at least an 80% max battery capacity, but the device I received only had a 77% max capacity when I first unboxed it and turned it on. While that may only be a 3% difference, every percent matters when it comes to diminished battery life. I will monitor how long it can stay at this level, if it causes any functionality issues, and how quickly it may decline further."
"Apple iPhone SE (2nd Generation), US Version, 64GB, White - Unlocked (Renewed)",Price not found,"I wasn't sure how beat up a used and old cell phone would be, but this was in good shape. Screen was without scratches, body was clean, no dents, etc. It had a scratch protector in place that I didn't want, but it was easy to remove. Not surprisingly, the battery was at 82% of it's original life. I kinda expected that. That's the life at which it is recommended that you replace the battery or get a new phone, so I suspect a lot of people turn in their still-functioning phones at that time. Phone arrived a few days earlier than promised, which was nice. I was able to transfer all my data easily from a previous backup. But I couldn't get my e-sim card to active and make phone calls. Took it to an ATT shop and they set it up for free.
I will probably try to replace the battery myself, but not without some trepidation. I ruined my previous Iphone 6 when I tried to replace the battery. I raised the right side of the phone after I had softened the glue sufficiently. The phone was so hot from using a heat gun that I raced to open the phone. Alas, I was supposed to raise the left side of the phone instead of the right, and broke some ribbon cables and ruining the phone. Let's see what goes wrong next time!"

I purchased this phone for my son so that he could use to play games, make calls, and edit videos. The only issue is the speaker. It captures audio (my son speaking for videos) but at times sounds muffled and hard to hear what is being recorded. I want to replace it so we can have a phone that will accurately pick up sound but I'm afraid that we will get one with some other issue. Besides the audio issue it really is near excellent."

"Apple iPhone SE (2nd Generation), US Version, 64GB, White - Unlocked (Renewed)",Price not found,"I am a big believer in using things as long as possible, so I was somewhat reluctant to replace my 6-year-old 1st gen iPhone SE (yes--I'm one of those), but more and more of my apps wouldn't update. I almost bought a new 3rd gen SE, but then I saw a used 2nd gen SE for under $140, and decided to save myself 300 bucks. I received it yesterday in like-new condition and I'm mostly pleased. The transfer process was fairly quick and easy using Bluetooth. I didn't realize how slow my old phone was until I used the new one, or how diminished its battery life had become. I will have to get used to a few differences in this model--no earphone jack, slightly bigger size in my pocket, different button location and feel--but I'm sure I'll adapt quickly. My one real complaint is that this used version had only 85% max battery capacity, so it'll probably need a new battery within a year. Considering the price, though, it's not that big of a deal."

"Apple iPhone SE (2nd Generation), US Version, 64GB, White - Unlocked (Renewed)",Price not found,"I previously purchased from Amazon Renewed an iPhone 5s, and was satisfied with it considering the price was barely over one hundred dollars. That phone, however, was originally released in 2013, and at 8 years old it was getting hard to justify its continued use.

So when the new iPhone SE (2020) was released I was really tempted to get it, but the pandemic had basically stopped any purchasing of anything for me at the time. Now in September of 2021, with the battery in my old phone failing, it was time to do something.

I decided to check out what Amazon might have in their ""renewed"" products and was surprised to find that they now have ""Renewed Premium"", which offers a year's satisfaction guarantee. That meant, in my mind, I could send this thing back if it wasn't good or turned out to be a lemon, so I sprung for it.

First of all, this one came in a nice box, oversized, and obviously sturdy enough to protect everything inside. It comes with an information packet describing what ""premium"" means, along with a quick start guide. The inclusion of a standard wall charger was nice, but I have a number of chargers already, not to mention my iPad Pro charger. I'll get back to that in a minute.

Another thing that was nice to have included was a tool for removing the SIM card tray. Nice, but it turns out that with the new iPhone SE you can use eSIM! More on that as well in a minute.

Now first of all... This phone looks gorgeous. The red color and the black front make for an awesome combination. All surfaces are smooth as if it was a brand new phone. Turning it on shows the screen is working perfectly, with even back lighting all across to each corner.

The first thing I checked was the ""battery health"". Amazon promises that with their renewed premium phones the battery would at least be at ninety percent of capacity, so I immediately checked.

Ninety-eight percent! Eight percent better than what they promised. Not bad at all!

So it turns out that this phone supports fast charging. So that means my phone gets charged on the desk where my iPad Pro sits, because the charger for that is a high capacity charger. The iPhone SE charges up easily in a little over an hour, which means no need to plug it in over night. In fact, I plug it in before bed, but it's plugged into an outlet controlled by Alexa and that wont come on till in the morning. The phone charges up to capacity before I go to work!

Now for setting up the service, the iPhone SE (2020) supports eSIM, which means getting set up with Mint Mobile (or any service that supports eSIM) was as easy as... Well, I went to Mint Mobile's website, checked my location, checked phone compatibility, chose my service plan, then chose eSIM at check out. A few minutes later a QR code appeared on the screen of my computer that I scanned with the iPhone SE, and a few seconds later I had 4G/LTE and everything ready to go.

eSIM is the way to go. It is, just trust me on that.

After about a week of using the phone, on some days like I normally do and on other day literally trying to cause it run dry of battery or trying to get it to malfunction, this little phone is holding up way better than I could have anticipated. I believe I can safely say my iPhone 5s can be retired for good.

By the way. Get a cover. This phone has a glass back, which means it can be charged wirelessly, but it also means you can break it easily. I got a simple transparent back cover with a raised bezel around the edges. It cost about 9 dollars, came in the same day as the phone.

I would recommend this phone and the Amazon Renewed Premium program. Yes the cost of the phone was more than it would have been with renewed only, but being able to return the phone for up to a year is worth it."

The medium tops fit me perfectly but the medium shorts are too small. I wish I could have ordered separate sizes. Otherwise I love them, could indeed wear them anywhere!"
"Apple iPhone SE (2nd Generation), US Version, 64GB, White - Unlocked (Renewed)",Price not found,"Ordering a used iPhone can be a risky venture but I have done it three times without issue.

The phone that Hybrid sent did have a defective earpiece speaker that made using the phone portion of the phone difficult to impossible. O thought maybe the company would haggle about such a seemingly minor issue and we would have to eat the cost and spend real money getting device through our cell carrier.

To the contrary, Hybrid was willing to exchange no questions asked and they were super prompt. Exchanged phone arrived within five days and was set up and good to go in minutes.

This is how I will buy phones for gf and family from here on out and this is who I will purchase from. I would certainly recommend if you just want a good phone for very reasonable price without needing to impress your friends with your consumerist bs. Even if you get a somewhat faulty device, Hybrid will make it right politely and promptly. Refurbishing and recycling these products is the way to go and Hybrid makes it a clean and simple process even if the odd defective device makes it thru the restoration process."

"Apple iPhone SE (2nd Generation), US Version, 64GB, White - Unlocked (Renewed)",Price not found,"PRO: Came with ""renewed premium"" product grade, which we wanted. We buy these phones because they are economical (can't afford brand new iPhones!). This is our second such purchase (we upgraded from iPhone 8's) to SE (2nd gen) watches. The watches we received look like they could be brand new, and the batteries in each are in very good condition. We also did not want iPhones with black or red cases, which meant the white case (more popular?) took a little longer to get. We also wanted the SE watch because they are the same size as the iPhone 8 so we could re-use the protective cases we already had. Upgradable to Apple iOS 17.X.X. And, they are compatible with Apple Watches model 8 and newer.
CON: The Apple iPhone SE (2nd Gen) has a black face when off (compared to the white face the iPhone 8 has). This makes it necessary to get used to finding the ""home"" button. I solved that problem by putting a small piece of colored tape next to it. They use 4G technology, not 5G.
GENERAL COMMENTS: For the most part, the iPhone SE-2 operation is like our iPhone 8's. So, not much of a learning curve. A couple of the displays that appear when in use are different, but that is not an issue. And a BIG PLUS for the two iPhone SE2's that I bought through Amazon is that Amazon will pay us a nice amount for our iPhone 8's when we clean them of all content and return them as instructed on the Amazon web site. Now, we have two watches that were sold in 2022 instead of 2 phones that were made in 2017. One reason we bought these two watches is so we could use them along with our Apple Watches (Model 8's) which we also just bought. When we carry our iPhones with us, then we can use our watches just as if the watches had the cellular feature some come with (ours didn't, by our choice)."

"Apple iPhone SE (2nd Generation), US Version, 64GB, White - Unlocked (Renewed)",Price not found,"This is the best phone I‚Äôve ever owned, in my opinion. I‚Äôm passionate about smartphones, and I‚Äôve loved previous high end Androids. This has a few key advantages over those devices.

Simplicity. I used to compile my own Gentoo. I understand the value of FOSS. Still, I‚Äôve come to decide that a personal communicator/ data assistant needs to be usable above all else. iOS is feature-complete, thoughtfully efficient, and free of redundancy beyond Android. The toddler‚Äôs interface i used on the iPod touch has matured into what it was meant to be

Reliability. I‚Äôve never had big problems with Android, but it can hiccup. On every phone I‚Äôve used over more than a decade, I‚Äôve occasionally experienced minor crashes, GPS gremlins, battery drains, cooling anomalies, and inscrutable major app discontinuations. In nearly a year of use, this old midrange iPhone has been utterly rock solid and i am confident Apple will not yank the rug out from under any of its core utilities. I do not manage the RAM on this phone or track battery usage. It‚Äôs just normal at all times.

Durability. I do not use phone cases. The concept is a bit bizarre to me from a design standpoint. It‚Äôs not ideal, but i just try to be very careful with my phone. I‚Äôm good enough at it that, since smartphones emerged, it has been overall worth it for me despite eventually breaking two phones in that period. Still, I‚Äôm aging and I‚Äôve dropped it. It‚Äôs clear that this phone is comprehensively designed; the materials and structure are unbelievably resistant to impact on hard surfaces. The damage to my phone is entirely cosmetic to the aluminum frame, and frankly makes me smile that it worked as intended in the face of adversity.

Performance. My last phone had significantly more raw computing power than this phone. Still, this phone has a smoother UI and, in my opinion, marks a significant point of diminishing returns in mobile processing power. Clearly, little of the hardware is wasted. It is well balanced.

Criticisms include: the ability to edit large blocks of text in iMessage has degraded since the last update. Moving the cursor has become more difficult. Battery life is mediocre. I can confidently get a day of normal use or a few hours of streaming video, and i have to charge it every night. My refurbished phone arrived with a gouge in the screen which i consider barely acceptable.

The experience is great. I‚Äôve lost interest in cracking software and customizing each UI element with unlimited freedom in favor of a workflow that aligns with my long-term goals. In that regard this phone excels. Lovely bit of hardware and software."

Now that I have seen this renewed iPhone at an affordable price (I bought it for my husband, a long time iPhone user) I may very well consider buying a renewed iPhone for myself in the future."

"Apple iPhone SE (2nd Generation), US Version, 64GB, White - Unlocked (Renewed)",Price not found,"I had an excellent experience with the seller, and the device came in perfect condition. The rest of this review will be about the device itself rather than my experience purchasing it refurbished.

EDIT: this review has been updated for the fall 2023 smartphone market conditions.

The Good

The A13 processor punches far above its weight and compares favorably with the best premium Android processors. This performance level in a phone at this price is very nice. You'll struggle to find a better deal for performance per dollar.

With the high end chip, you're also getting camera smarts well above what a single lens shooter should be capable of achieving. While not beating the cheaper Pixel 3a with its multi lens design and Google algorithms, do not underestimate this single camera and brains combination. I found it quite adequate for casual and social media use, so it will struggle in low light conditions due to the notable lack of Night Sight found on newer phones.

The phone feels premium and is extremely lightweight still. Wireless charging and Wi-Fi 6 are bonuses that we typically don't see in this part of the market.

Apple will support this device for most likely two more years based on the typical support life cycle. This is as expected for the price point whether you go Apple or Android.

The Bad

The biggest limitation of this phone is the small battery design that hasn't been updated in years. It's the same as the iPhone 8 aside from the upgrades to the internals. This means you're getting iPhone 8 battery life. Unless you are a light user, you'll need to top up the charge before the day is through when combined with that A13 engine. This is like a sporty hatchback with a tiny gas tank. Other phones in the segment have nearly double the battery capacity, and the super fast A13 gives you ample opportunity to spend it.

That dated design brings with it a small LCD screen when most of the world has moved on to LED technology. While the screen is one of the best given the technology in use, the display technology is obsolete. The display is objectively less color accurate and less sharp the newer display technology. Only cheaper phones still use LCD today. With that said, it's still a pretty good display with adequate contrast and brilliant colors. It is the best you can get if you don't mind the older technology class.

Summary: Insanely powerful engine strapped to a tiny battery wrapped up in yesterday's package.

I would recommend this for light to moderate users who often have access to charging during the day, and anyone who wants to get into the Apple world at a lowest price point.

I would not recommend this device to someone who plans to use it for watching HD videos, plays games for long periods, or is usually far away from an outlet. I think this person would prefer a device with a more up-to-date display and better battery capacity."
"Apple iPhone SE (2nd Generation), US Version, 64GB, White - Unlocked (Renewed)",Price not found,"So, the first SE was delayed a couple weeks due to storms; OK with me. But when it finally arrived Apple immediately threw up a message that the battery condition was critically low and the battery should be replaced. Battery Maximum Capacity was only 79%. I deduct one star for this. Seller guarantees 80% minimum, so I sent it back and asked them to send me a replacement. Maybe it was 80% when they sent it?! I don't know. BTW all the phone exterior looked like new.

The replacement SE also looks like new (and I am extremely picky---especially regarding screen condition.) I was really happy to see the Battery Maximum Capacity of this replacement at 93%(!) Way better than 79% you might agree.

I have only one dedicated purpose for this SE and that is to run the Ecobee app to set their security system on and off. I mount this on the wall right next to my Ring keypad. Suits me fine: *2* security systems. (I was using an iPhone 7 but its screen is defective slightly, it's a lot slower and it's not compatible with Apple's newest software = too old.)

Overall I am very happy with the replacement SE, which BTW arrived very fast."
"Apple iPhone SE (2nd Generation), US Version, 64GB, White - Unlocked (Renewed)",Price not found,"An honest, not bogus review here. This was a great purchase, and after seeing what my local pawn shop wanted for a used iPhone SE (much more than this Renewed one), I rolled the dice and ordered this phone. Overall this is a solid 9.5 out of 10, and if the battery was above 90% overall life I would give it a 10/10 as a renewed product (the battery was at 88-89% if memory serves correct.
This a CLEAN phone with no scratches anywhere that I could see, and for the money I spent if the battery was at 100% and you told me this was a new old stock phone with a screen protector on it I would have believed you - it is that clean of a renewed phone (and NO this is not a paid review I would not waste your time here...)
This runs iOS 17 just fine, and if you want a small (by today's standards) phone to run iOS, make calls, send texts, take a few photos and just have an easy simple phone in your pocket (that is still very powerful, can shoot 4k video and the red color looks fantastic) - look no further; order this renewed phone today."

"Apple iPhone SE (2nd Generation), US Version, 64GB, White - Unlocked (Renewed)",Price not found,"I ordered this Iphone after reading all the great reviews. It arrived pomptly. However upon opening up the box, I observed there was no charger although there was a charging cable and sim removal tool. The phone was dead and I used my husband's charger to charge it. I then observed a sticker at the back of the phone indicating that it had been checked in November 2023 and was described as good. The battery health was however 79%, less than what was expected. A further check of the battery health confirmed the info (photo 2). The phone itself was in good condition however.
I contacted the seller and informed of the situation. I asked that the charger be sent which they agreed to do. To date I have not received same. I have also not been able to fully set up the phone and at this point am considering returning item. This is my first time purchasing a used phone. Maybe I am just unfortunate to receive one not as good as others have. But I do admit to being surprised that an item with less than the initial mininum battery power of 80%, was sent to me.
Under the circumstances I will not purchase another phone from this company."

"Apple iPhone SE (2nd Generation), US Version, 64GB, White - Unlocked (Renewed)",Price not found,"I am so happy with this phone! I was about to buy from another well known site that sells used phones when I discovered that amazon sells refurbished ones and that are fully operational, checked for quality, have a 90 day warranty AND are unlocked!. My 11 yr old daughter had an iphone SE since she was 7 and took good care of it till it accidentally slipped from her hand onto concrete. Even though she was very responsible with it for a long time, I still dont see the sense in getting a brand new phone and spending hundreds of dollars on it for a kid. Even adults have accidents with their phones sometimes and I think the chances are higher with a kid. So when I discovered this option I was overjoyed. It does everything she wants to do - call, text, go on the internet, download apps and games and hers has 5G (careful because I think amazon also sells a 2G one, so I made sure to get this one that says 5G). And this way, if she has a horrible accident with it, Im not out hundreds of dollars. The one she got looks almost new, only a very light scratch on the back which is covered with a case anyway. All we had to do was take her sim card out if her old phone and put it in the new phone and then it asked if we had a nearby apple device we‚Äôd like to sync it with (in this case, her tablet) and it walked us through that process. It really couldn‚Äôt have been easier! The phone even came with a little tool for getting the sim card out! And a generic brand charger to charge the phone with. I am SO happy with this purchase! Thank you Amazon for having these available at an affordable price!! Affordable options like this are why I keep shopping with Amazon! Oh and the battery health was pretty good, better than my current phone! Maximum charging capacity 91%. For a refurbished phone that is excellent"

I ran an additional factory reset after noticing this. The device arrived with an off-brand charger. Additionally the battery showed 92% of maximum capacity when it arrived, now after only 24 days of use the battery shows 74% of maximum capacity. It has been hot where I live but I use AC while driving and the phone has never displayed any kind of temperature warning. Additionally I am only charging with a brand-new Apple-brand 20W charger that I bought from a local Apple store so the rapid degradation of the battery seems worrisome to me."

Battery was dead on arrival, but after I charged it... It seems to be holding charge very good. They probably just missed to charge it before shipping or they have these just sitting for months. Anyway... My advice just get the cheapest possible and go in with no expectations, then there is no chance of those expectations to be ruined. For a $100 I needed this for a 2nd phone and a dashcam. Works well for that."

"Apple iPhone SE (2nd Generation), US Version, 64GB, White - Unlocked (Renewed)",Price not found,"I bought this phone only 3 months ago (February 2024) and while the phone at first had absolutely no issues I‚Äôm now experiencing multiple issues with this phone that should not be happening within only 3 months of having the device.

For example:
‚Ä¢ Auto capitalization is toggled ‚Äúon‚Äù but still fails to capitalize words correctly. Autocorrect doesn‚Äôt work properly as-well which makes it harder and longer to type on anything.
‚Ä¢ Home button and device glitches and doesn‚Äôt show certain widgets on screen (they all go black colored and unusable).
‚Ä¢ fingerprint malfunctions and doesn‚Äôt scan properly no matter how many fingerprint restarts I make. It makes it very hard to get my passwords and opening my device.
‚Ä¢Battery came degraded and obviously became more negative overtime. Dies within 3 hours of usage to this day.

There are little to no amazing things about the phone anymore. Only positive feedback I have is that it still does work overall as a very cheap burner phone. It still can text and call, it still is functional besides some glitches and the camera still works properly. There still is appropriate space on the phone for photos and apps so I can‚Äôt complain too much. I am getting another phone soon to replace this one and this one will be my back up iPhone."

I needed a new phone fast after my cat knocked mine into the sink ‚òπÔ∏è Rice fixed it for a while, but it was only temporary before it died altogether.

I hate buying phones and avoid it whenever possible. 99% of mine belonged to someone in my family first. And i was good with that. Needless to say, my cat didn‚Äôt wait for someone in my family to upgrade. I was on my own this time.

Okay.... that‚Äôs not entirely true. My grandma had an iPhone 7 sitting around so that held me over in the meantime. Going from an iPhone 11 Pro Max to an iPhone 7 was‚Ä¶.bad. It was too dam small, in every possible way. 32 gigs of memory!! I needed an upgrade. Fast. My 11 year old was bullying me relentlessly. And that‚Äôs on me. They had my old XR (formerly my dad‚Äôs)

I scoured FB marketplace. I‚Äôd decided upgrade a little, so I could feel better about the switch. I didn‚Äôt want to feel backed me into a corner by my cat‚Äôs recklessness. I would get a slightly newer model in a fun colour.

Marketplace had plenty. Sending message after message from my iPhone 7, I worried. ‚ÄúThis person seems too eager‚Äù, ‚Äúthis one has been posted so long‚Äù, ‚ÄúI want a purple, but the only purple one listed has less storage space‚Äù and ‚Äúthe pretty green one has a small crack‚Äù, ‚Äúthis guy lives 2 hours from me‚Äù and ‚ÄúBattery life? Errr last time I checked it was like 74%?‚Ä¶.no, I can‚Äôt take a screenshot of it, it‚Äôs turned off‚Äù‚Ä¶. ‚Äúcash only please‚Äù Etc.

So much pressure. What happens if the thing doesn‚Äôt work? That‚Äôs $300+ down the drain. I knew I couldn‚Äôt afford new. But I hated the idea of buying something used from a stranger on Facebook. I didn‚Äôt want to get scammed, and I also didn‚Äôt want to settle.

That‚Äôs when I remembered good ol‚Äô Amazon. Maybe I‚Äôd check there. Just for funsies. Probably out of my budget, but it couldn‚Äôt hurt.

Sure enough, refurbished devices selling ‚Äúlike new!‚Äù Mostly same cost or less than what I‚Äôd found so far. Surely there was a catch? I read through everything, tested by Amazon, includes all the specs, unlocked, I can pick the colour, the storage size, the condition, etc. AND I could have it delivered to me tomorrow??! With a warranty?!!

I recovered from my brief stint of disappointment after learning the 12‚Äôs don‚Äôt come in yellow. Then fought hard to decide between mint and lavender. The lavender would take an extra day to arrive. Mint it was!!

As promised, it arrived the next day. It was in beautiful shape. 128g‚Äôs, mint green, not a single scratch, 86% battery life. All for less than I would have paid to some stranger for a 64g with some ‚Äúsmall scratches‚Äù

Once my case and screen protector arrived I excitedly set it up and synced my data.

Oh no.

After becoming used to facial recognition, having that yanked away, and dealing with a 7 for over 2 weeks‚Äî I was desperate for the convenience of Face ID. I had been using my fingerprint. Like a *caveman*.

Not to mention I have Blink 182 tickets, and it specifically states facial recognition is required to access the mobile tickets. Idk if that‚Äôs true, but I needed Face ID!!

I googled, I contacted apple support. Fixing it could be upwards of $300. That‚Äôs almost what I paid for the whole phone!!

I realllllly didn‚Äôt want to be stuck without a phone again. But I also wanted one fully functioning.

So I reached out to Amazon support and explained. The rep was incredibly helpful (as most Amazon reps are) and after bts failed, she advised the ship was a 3rd party seller, and she send a message to them. ‚ÄúIf they don‚Äôt fix it by (insert date) contact us back and we‚Äôll make this right‚Äù she encouraged.

I‚Äôm ngl. I was nervous. I didn‚Äôt have high hopes, having dealt with 3p sellers on Amazon in the past. At least Amazon had my back, ig. The concert wasn‚Äôt till July. Even without facial recognition, it was loads better than the 7. I could make do in the meantime.

The seller came in clutch though, and my worry was unwarranted. They responded within minutes. They were receptive, apologetic, and more than willing to help.

As I‚Äôd anticipated, they offered a refund or exchange, as soon as they received the return. I explained my concern with not having a phone for several days or more; and the merchant offered to overnight a replacement as soon as the return was dropped off.

I could deal with one day without a phone! I gratefully accepted. That was Saturday night, we made plans to catch up Monday for the return instructions and for them to overnight it.

Monday I reached back out; and they were ready to ship, BUT they *had no more green‚Ä¶.* ü´¢ SHOCK
‚Äú‚Ä¶do you have purple‚Äù
No. :( just blue, white, and black.

THIS WAS A HUGE BUMMER.It‚Äôs silly I know, and the definition of *first world problems ‚Äú.. but I mean‚Ä¶. My change of heart about this whole phone thing HINGED ON THE FUN COLOUR. Without it, I was just a person‚Ä¶out $350‚Ä¶ because my cat was thirsty while I was watching YouTube while washing dishes. I needed a cool colour. Plus, I‚Äôd already gotten the matching case! Clear with mint green borders.

It wasn‚Äôt even a fun blue‚Ä¶ it was a dark, serious, navy blue. It was pretty and classy, but I wanted something fun. I even asked if he had any older models in yellow üò≠üò≠ no luck,

They told me they‚Äôd be restocking in a day or so. Still, no greens or purples came in.

Ugh. Reality was setting in. I was going to have to settle. It was fine, I thought. At least it would be a fully functioning phone.

No. I wasn‚Äôt ready to let go. They assured me I could take my time to decide, and I asked if we could wait another week in case one came in. If it didn‚Äôt, *then* I would choose from the options available.

I messaged them Wednesday afternoon, bracing myself for the answer‚Ä¶. THEY GOT IN PURPLE! YAY.

They sent a label, I dropped it off, sent a photo, and had my new phone the next morning.

they‚Äôd said overnight shipping‚Ä¶ but wow! I‚Äôd dropped off the return around 3pm, and had the replacement by noon the next day. I didn‚Äôt even have my new case yet üòÖ

Despite the Barney-Esque colour scheme my mint green case created, the lavender is GORGEOUS and I‚Äôm actually sort of glad the green didn‚Äôt work out.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the green is also gorgeous.. but in the end I‚Äôm glad I ended up with the lavender. I was overjoyed when I was prompted to set Face ID during setup. Worked brilliantly, as did everything else.

Great packaging, no cosmetic flaws, amazing battery life, customer service was great, and best of all‚Ä¶ ITS PURPLE!

Can‚Äôt wait to pair it with the new case. I‚Äôm so glad I went this route where I have some peace of mind as a buyer.

I‚Äôm grateful to the seller for being so helpful and patient with me as insufferable as I must have seemed making such a fuss over colour preference

If you‚Äôre nervous buying a phone used or refurbished too, hopefully you can take comfort in knowing- this seller is legit. You receive a good quality product, and, speaking from experience, they‚Äôll gladly help resolve any issues you may run into."
"Apple iPhone 12, 64GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",Price not found,"My reason for purchasing an iPhone was probably different than most people. I have a Samsung phone that use daily and I am very happy with it. It is on a carrier that is not one of the ""big names"". It suits my purposes fine.
My mother invited me to accompany her to Europe. This is a once in a lifetime trip for me, but I soon realized my inexpensive Samsung phone would not work there. Believe me, I tried. The best way to have a working phone while in Europe so I could stay in contact with my business was to invest in an iPhone. I decided on the iPhone 12 and bought a refurbished one.
I researched the sellers and their profiles before ordering. I finally decided on MOBILESUPPLY because they have an incredibly high rating. They did not disappoint!
The first phone I purchased was purple. It arrived in excellent condition visually. No scratches, no marks and actually looked like a brand new phone. It charged up to 82% which was great. Everything was wonderful. Then I set it up (which took me a couple of YouTube tutorials being a long time android user). I couldn't hear on the phone without using my earbuds or having it plugged into my vehicle.
I thought maybe it was me, so I tested it with several people calling them and having them call me and finally I gave it to my husband, then son to get their opinion. Nope, wasn't me.
MOBILESUPPLY answered my question immediately and it was no issue to replace the phone. They sent a prepaid label and the same day they received my phone they shipped a new one out to me. The replacement phone was blue, but that isn't an issue. It charges to 93% and again, appears brand new. It works great, I can hear and now I am ready to go on my trip with my Mom.
This entire experience was a lot of research and I am so glad I bought from Amazon, and picked the seller I did.
My advise is to think of your needs for purchasing a ""new"" phone and to do your research on sellers. Amazon offers an amazing choice to pick from.
Hope that helps."
"Apple iPhone 12, 64GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",Price not found,"I got the renewed for 289. Bought this for my mother who loses things a lot so getting something in pristine condition for under 300 dollars is a great way to avoid the expense of a new phone with features that would go unused/unnoticed. Mine appeared brand new so was probably immediately placed in an Otter Box at time of original purchase. Battery seems ok but only time will tell but Apple only warranties new batteries for year anyway. Also came unlocked with no SIMM card and wiped clean just like my new 12 I got 3 years ago. Only took about 10 minutes to add to my Spectrum Mobile account. Only think I will add has nothing to do with the device but to keep in mind with a third-party seller. Price dropped around 40 bucks as soon as I received it. Did not expect Amazon to or the seller to honor it but spent about 15 minutes on their chat only to call a live rep. Then was told they have no control over 3rd party pricing as it is up to the seller. Again, not a big deal but just annoying that I could not get this answer in a minute or two though chat. Finally, if something does go wrong, I was told I would have to work with the seller instead of Amazon and discuss warranty with them. All in all 5 star for item and the latter part of this review is really more of a rant on the quality of Amazon Customer Service over the last 12 years of being a member"
"Apple iPhone 12, 64GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",Price not found,"I purchased the (Product)Red 64GB version Refurbished - Excellent iPhone 12. When I received and unboxed the phone, I realized it looked brand new except what appears to be a small scratch at the bottom of the screen. Do I wish the scratch was on the back or anywhere else other than the screen? Sure but if that's the only blemish, I'm happy with it.

Not sure if this is standard but mine came with a screen protector installed which happens to hide the scratch pretty well making it difficult to notice unless you're looking right at it.

After I finished setting up and configuring the phone with T-Mobile, I checked the battery health. I would have been perfectly happy with a max capacity around 90% but to my surprise, it's 100%!!

I purchased a red set of Samsung Galaxy Buds Live that are refurbished but happen to look new as well to pair with the phone. They work perfectly together and the red color of both the phone and ear buds are a great match.

Overall, I really like this phone!! Maybe I got lucky with the condition but this is one of the better purchases I've made recently. I recommend this phone to anyone looking for a decent iPhone that can't afford a current model. I upgraded from an iPhone 8 so this a big leap from that. The differences between the newer models gets less and less as you move up to the 15 so getting the 12 is a really good option. The 12 even has the same shape and size as an iPhone 15.

Hope everyone who buys one gets a phone in like new condition like I did :)"
"Apple iPhone 12, 64GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",Price not found,My old iPhone ‚Äúdied‚Äù on me and it would have cost me almost as much to repair it as to replace it. This phone works very well. I was able to get most of my stuff back from my iPhone backups. There wasn‚Äôt much in the way of instructions and I had a bit of a challenge because my old iPhone had a button at the bottom to select and turn off apps and turning on and off the new iPhone was a bit challenging to figure out but once I got that ‚Äúswiping ‚Äú the screen stopped apps and holding the power button with the volume button brought up the turn off option I was fine. I think the screen is better than my old one and now I‚Äôm accustomed to it I like the new iPhone better.
"Apple iPhone 12, 64GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",Price not found,Well I finally caved and decided to go back to iPhone. My current androids are starting to give me problems. The last time I used an iPhone was during the 4s and 5s era iPhone's. So yeah I am definitely behind on all things iPhone. I wanted something that I wouldn't spend so much. I managed to find a 12 and now I just need to get my apple account unlocked so I can start using the phone. Phone came in good condition it does have a few scratches and one on the screen but its no deal breaker at all. Will update as soon as that is all resolved
"Apple iPhone 12, 64GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",Price not found,"I thought I was getting a refurbished phone in excellent condition? Well I would say that it is not in excellent condition but in okay condition. It is definitely refurbished. Cons: It came in dead, with scuffs and chips all over the paint, a weird little black spot in the screen, and the battery is only at 77% capacity. Pros: Functions fine, holds an alright charge, easy to use, no problems setting up carrier. This phone physically is beat up, and functions as it should. I‚Äôm not satisfied with the price I paid for the sheer quality of this phone, somebody definitely over exaggerated its greatness, because it‚Äôs PHYSICALLY not in excellent condition. But for now it will do! So if you want a phone for short money that functions fine and don‚Äôt care about the physical appearance, this phone is for you! But if you expect a fairly new, barely scratched phone, look elsewhere my friend! 3/5 phone."
"Apple iPhone 12, 64GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",Price not found,"Refurbished iPhone 12 received in two days to replace lost iPhone 11. Received in excellent condition (...no face scratches) as advertised. Was able to add my old number to the phone (...using tips from Apple Tech Support); then erase all existing Apps & Data on the iPhone 12 (...except for the eSIM!) & then upload my Apps & Data from my old phone using iCloud Backup. Had to log in and re-establish 2FA with a few of the Apps, but no major issues with that, and was back in business!

Only annoying aspect was that the supplied charger cable stopped working after a day, but I had plenty others laying around.

Overall, a very gratifying experience, and now I have 5G access. Tip: If you utilize 2FA for some of your Apps; if they permit, set up the option of BOTH a phone number & an email...from laptop, in case you lose your phone."
"Apple iPhone 12, 64GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",Price not found,"I really do like the phone, I got the refurbished excellent quality, it charges relatively fast and dies just as fast, the main thing I cannot stand about it though is how fast it overheats, I‚Äôm unsure if this is just an iPhone 12 problem or whatever the case may be, but I do despise how due to it overheating it sometimes moves faster than the phone I replaced. Other than that it‚Äôs pretty okay. It‚Äôs an iPhone it‚Äôs everything you‚Äôd expect it to be."
"Apple iPhone 12, 64GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",Price not found,"This might be the most traveled phone this year. Arrived quickly at the drop shipper location in Miami before being forwarded to me, an expat living in Ecuador.

Well after long delays at customs here in Ecuador it was returned to Miami. Refurbished phones are not allowed to be imported into Ecuador. Long story short after two trips around the US it was hand delivered yesterday by a helpful traveler.

The phone arrived (refurbished premium) in perfect physical shape, not a mark or scratch. It functions flawlessly. Why the 4 stars? I would gladly give 5 save for that premium phones are guaranteed to exceed 90% battery life, sadly this one is at 88% so a bit short. It‚Äôs been over two months since ordering so I‚Äôm gladly keeping this iPhone 12."
"Apple iPhone 12, 64GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",Price not found,"My phone arrived in pristine condition. It was very easy to set up and transfer data from my old iPhone.

I‚Äôm upset that I‚Äôll have to spend more money to get a better battery sooner than I expected, but the quality of the phone itself still made it a worthwhile purchase."
"Apple iPhone 12, 64GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",Price not found,"I have been using the phone for around 10 days and it works perfectly fine. It did not have a single scratch. Battery life came with 92%, the only thing is that sometimes when I‚Äôm on a call with someone, signals cuts off but it happens when I‚Äôm outside my house. I‚Äôm still testing the phone to figure out if it‚Äôs a problem the phone has or it‚Äôs just me not having good signal but so far that‚Äôs the only thing I‚Äôm still testing so that‚Äôs the only why I gave it a 4 out of 5 but other than that I‚Äôm impressed and happy with the phone. I mostly think it‚Äôs just the place that have bad signal but I want to make sure. I‚Äôll be back to write my final review ."
"Apple iPhone 12, 64GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",Price not found,"The iPhone appeared in excellent condition as I unpacked it. I had no problem transferring everything from my old phone, BUT when I tried to use the camera to take a picture of a card, I discovered that the picture was not in focus.

Then, when I went into the 'setting' to do some corrections, I discover a statement that said ""The camera for this iPhone is not recognized. An Apple Authorized Service Provider can repair or replace the camera to restore full functionality."". Apparently, the 'remanufacturer' has installed a second-rate camera into this phone."

"Apple iPhone 12, 64GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",Price not found,"Like the lightness compared to my Samsung S24 Ultra. No scratches. Looks new. Battery charges to 100%
Audio is subpar compared to the Ultra, not as loud and quality not as good.
I don't like the lightning port. Wish it was the same as my S24 Ultra.
In my case I could not get the Hotspot to work. However I did not take it to ATT to see if they could get it to work. That's not why I bought this phone. Amazon has a relatively new gps wrist band tracker that has no monthly fee and it only works with the iPhone. It does not work with Android and I need it to keep tabs on my friend with dementia. So far it works great. It's better than having to pay as much as $50 a month like some trackers on Amazon. So far I'm happy with the iPhone. It's a keeper and can also serve as a backup phone.
Sorry my review is not more in depth."

"Apple iPhone 12, 64GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",Price not found,"I am a 19 year old broke college student, but I have had the Iphone XR since my freshman year of highschool... I am a rising junior now. Though my XR did my well over the years, she recently started shutting off on me at random times, would die after 30 minutes of use after being charged fully. I was just wayyyy past due for a new phone, so I got this one. This was one of my first big girl purchases, so I was a little worried that something was going to be wrong with the phone, seeing as I saw quite a few reviews complaining of issues with their phones, but I haven't had any problems yet. Face ID works perfectly, extremely minor scratches (so unnoticeable I was only able to tell because I was strictly looking for them), easy to switch over to my carrier (literally just inserted the old sim card, and 30 minutes later EVERYTHING transferred over with no issues). Honestly, this is a REALLY good deal if you're looking for a more cheap route than having to buy a phone straight from Apple.

Now, the only issue, which I dont fully see as an issue and youll understand why but the battery. The biggest issue with my old phone was how quickly it died. It was impossible to go out for longer than 3 hours without my phone dying. The first setting I checked on the new phone was the battery capacity, and although I was really really upset when I saw it was also at 80% like my last phone, I dont really know if that number is fully true. I recieved my phone yesterday, and havent charged it since the afternoon of that day, and it is still on 49% which would NEVER happen with my old phone. SO, I put the rating down one star because it does still say that the battery capacity is 80%, but I just havent really seen that as of yet!

Hope you guys found my review useful, and I highly HIGHLY recommend buying this product. Just make sure to double-check the ratings of the seller you're buying from. For me, the black color of the iPhone 12 came from a different buyer than the blue color. The black phone color seller has 3.2-star ratings while the blue phone seller has a 4.5-star rating, so I went with a color I wouldn't have usually gone with to higher my chances of receiving a phone in better condition!"

Once I received my phone, I was unable to port it to my existing service provider (Xfinity Mobile) because, according to them, the IMEI was not compatible with their network. I contacted Amazon customer support and they immediately offered to refund my money, but I liked the phone and did not want to exchange it. They they put me in contact with Apple Support and stayed on the line with me until Apple had answered their line.
I ultimately decided to go with another carrier (Mint Mobile) because they confirmed that the IMEI was compatible with their network and they were able to deliver my SIM card virtually, so I was able to use my phone immediately.
The problem with my Xfinity was not a problem with the phone itself and I was quite happy that, even though it was not their problem, Amazon was immediately willing to work with me. Could not be happier with the outcome, especially since Mint is 50% cheaper than Xfinity."

Just the past few nights, it went from 80% to 20% while not in use in Do Not Disturb or Sleep Mode. Last night it went from 40% to dead. The battery is at 87% performance supposedly which is 10% higher than my XR but it holds a battery worse.

Can be set up quickly, if you know all your passwords (I didn't and was running around looking for them). Apple care and AT&T were worse than useless in helping me set up the phone. Even provided wrong information. When I gave up on receiving assistance, I was able to set it up by myself (though I am totally not knowledgeable about these things). Phone battery charges to 100%. This is my first iPhone. Up to now I have used a Jitterbug phone and will keep that phone for the services it provides.

"Apple iPhone 12, 64GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",Price not found,Phone in excellent condition. Battery health 95%. I like that iPhone 12 screen does not have any curved edge so my glass screen protector goes on flawlessly and does start separating at the edge over time. Great camera over prior models. Just a note that home button is replaced by a virtual whit bar at bottom. Easy transition to get used to. Also the phone power turn off is a little different since home button is gone and takes a little to remember the buttons to press to activate.

"Apple iPhone 12, 64GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",Price not found,"Found out that the phone I purchased had the screen assumed replaced. The reason is that the phone screen has a slight curve that prevented me from ever installing a glass screen protector properly, always leaving me a halo ring on the edges. I had a store attempt to install a screen protector too, and they were not able to get rid of a halo ring on the edges of the screen. The lady suggested to have the screen protected with plastic. There is nothing wrong with the touch functionality and display itself, it's just that I wasted 3 different glass screen protectors from different brands as a result.

Aside from that, the phone works properly, although I did notice the battery has been of slight decline."

"Apple iPhone 12, 64GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",Price not found,"It is a personal phone. I bought the used iPhone 12 unlocked but I finally had to go to the Boost mobile store and they spent over an hour setting it up.

After about a week, the screen froze in the super magnification mode. The phone wouldn't open. It wouldn't recognize my face and it wouldn't recognize the lock code numbers. This happened 2 times and it worked after I let the battery run down and recharged it and I was able to restart it and open it. However the third time, I couldn't seem to run it down. It doesn't help that the iPhone battery level is unreadable. There was an Apple store at a nearby mall. It had a half dozen technicians. The one I got had me do the recommended things like pressing the side buttons and all and it didn't work. So I had to reset it. I noticed that at the other stations, all of the other techs were telling people to reset their phones, too. Resetting loses your unbackedup data like contacts. The apps have to be reloaded too. Fortunately my phone was new and I didn't have many of those.

Too bad LG doesn't make a 5G phone."

I prefer the 11 over the 13.

I was not sure how it would go transferring 125gb of data. I did the quick start feature and within an hour my new phone was exactly like my old one.

The phone came to me in great shape. The back and edges had no issues, and the screen has 2 small smudges or shades of scratches. These do not bother me one bit because it is worlds better than my old one.

This phone has a 94% battery life, and everything seems to work well. I ran a diagnostic app and every feature works great on this phone. And SIM card easily swapped over even though my 13 had 5g compatibility and this one does not.

Either way, I would say to definitley go with this phone. There‚Äôs no point in buying the new $1200 every year. Buy a used one like this one that is identical to the new one."
"Apple iPhone 11, 64GB, White - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",Price not found,"Update: I'm back with an update on our journey with the iPhone 11, and let me tell you, it's been quite the rollercoaster. Initially, I bought one for my daughter from a different seller, and it was, to put it mildly, a bit of a disaster. We had issues left and right ‚Äì Face ID not working, the phone overheating ‚Äì you name it. So, we returned it, feeling a bit skeptical about the whole refurbished scene.

But here's where the plot twists: we decided to give it another go, this time purchasing from the Amazon resellers store, specifically from a shop called Hybrid IT. And oh boy, what a difference! The iPhone we received this time around was nothing short of impeccable. It arrived with all the essentials ‚Äì a charger, a charging cable, and even a SIM card tool, all neatly packed. The phone itself? It could've fooled me for brand new.

This experience really hammered home the lesson that when it comes to refurbished goods, the ""who"" is just as crucial as the ""what."" The quality and condition of the product can vary wildly depending on the seller. Hybrid IT sent out an excellent product that exceeded our expectations in every way.

For those of you wary about diving into the world of refurbished electronics, let this be a testament. With the right seller, you can get your hands on a device that feels brand new, without the hefty price tag. We're over the moon with our iPhone 11, and I'll be sure to keep you all posted if anything changes. But for now, it seems like we've struck gold.

--------------------

I recently found myself in need of a quick replacement after my daughter accidentally broke her phone. The Apple iPhone 11, 64GB in black, seemed like a promising choice, primarily because we needed something that could be set up swiftly and would perform seamlessly as a backup.

Out of the box, the iPhone 11 felt like a brand-new device despite being a model released a few years back. The sleek black finish and the familiar design immediately caught my eye, reassuring me that this choice would not disappoint.

Setting up the iPhone 11 was mostly straightforward, especially with the unlocked version making it easy to switch from the old device. The transfer of data and settings from the previous iPhone was seamless, thanks to Apple's ecosystem. However, we hit a slight snag with the Face ID setup - it took a bit longer than expected to get it working properly. Despite this hiccup, once configured, Face ID has been working flawlessly.

The iPhone 11's performance has been impressive. The touch screen is responsive, making navigation and typing a breeze. Wi-Fi connectivity is fast, ensuring that browsing and app downloads are efficient. Although it's not the latest model, it handles everyday tasks with ease, from streaming video content to gaming, without any noticeable lag.

The main issue we encountered was the initial difficulty in setting up Face ID. It required a few attempts to configure, which was a minor inconvenience in an otherwise smooth setup process. After overcoming this challenge, the phone has been working perfectly.

Overall, this refurbished Apple iPhone 11 has proven to be a reliable and efficient backup phone. Its ease of setup, fast Wi-Fi, and responsive touch screen make it feel like a new device. The hiccup with Face ID setup was a small obstacle that, once overcome, didn't detract from the overall positive experience. I would recommend the iPhone 11 to anyone in need of a quick replacement or a dependable backup device"
"Apple iPhone 11, 64GB, White - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",Price not found,"Looking into buying another iphone for my daughter. Im going to buy myself another one and give her this one. I paid $300 for this purple iphone 11 about 2 years ago. So far no problems. I actually bought 3 at the same time. The only reason my daughter needs a new phone (2 years later) is because shes a teenager and keeps dropping her phone. It still works but her camera is cracked. Im so happy to get these phones instead of brand new ones!!! So far, ive been so lucky with these phones. These 3 werent my first. I bought some iphone 8+ phones before this and never had problems.

"Apple iPhone 11, 64GB, White - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",Price not found,"I recently purchased the iPhone 11 256GB Renewed, and overall, I‚Äôm quite satisfied with my purchase. Here are my thoughts:

Pros:

Great Value: For a renewed phone, it offers excellent value. The price is significantly lower than a brand-new model, yet it performs almost as well.

Battery Health: The battery health was at 90% when I received it, which is impressive for a renewed device.

Camera Quality: The camera is fantastic, capturing clear and vibrant photos. It‚Äôs perfect for everyday photography.

Storage Capacity: With 256GB of storage, I have plenty of space for apps, photos, and videos without worrying about running out of space.

Cons:

Minor Scratches: There were a few minor scratches on the back, but nothing too noticeable or affecting functionality.

Accessories: The phone came with a generic charger and cable, which work fine but aren‚Äôt as high-quality as the original Apple accessories.

Echo Issue: Occasionally, there‚Äôs a slight echo during calls, but it‚Äôs not a deal-breaker for me.

Overall: If you‚Äôre looking for a budget-friendly iPhone with ample storage and great performance, the iPhone 11 256GB Renewed is a solid choice. Just be prepared for a few minor imperfections that come with a renewed product."
"Apple iPhone 11, 64GB, White - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",Price not found,"I needed a new phone, ASAP. Thankfully, Amazon had a great selection of refurbished devices to choose from. The iPhone 11 stuck out to me for its affordability and somewhat recent release date. Upon arrival, the phone had near 0 scratches, and was factory unlocked as promised. HOWEVER, the battery was at 71% (!!!!) which made me freak out! I immediately contacted their support on a Saturday afternoon, and they gave me the option of taking it to the Apple Store for a battery replacement‚Äî free of charge. I was honestly surprised that they were willing to do so, and in a few days, every dime I spent on the repair was sent through an Amazon Refund back on my card. Now a few months later, the phone is just what I needed and even better with a 100% health battery!

(P.S- the seller was MOBILESUPPLY. They‚Äôre awesome!)"

If you're in the market for a smartphone that seamlessly marries cutting-edge technology with sleek design, look no further than the Apple iPhone 11. As a devoted Apple enthusiast, I recently upgraded to this model, and I must say, it's exceeded my already high expectations.

Let's start with the design. The iPhone 11 boasts a stunning 6.1-inch Liquid Retina HD display that truly brings everything to life, from vibrant photos to immersive gaming experiences. The build quality is impeccable, with a robust aerospace-grade aluminum and glass construction that feels premium in the hand. The matte finish on the back not only looks sophisticated but also minimizes fingerprints, which is a practical touch.

Performance-wise, the iPhone 11 is a powerhouse. The A13 Bionic chip ensures lightning-fast responsiveness, whether you're multitasking between apps, editing videos on the go, or playing graphics-intensive games. This phone handles it all effortlessly. Plus, with iOS, you get the smoothest, most intuitive user experience in the smartphone world. Updates are timely, and the ecosystem seamlessly integrates with other Apple devices if you're part of the ecosystem.

Now, let's talk about the camera setup‚Äîa standout feature of the iPhone 11. The dual-camera system (12MP Ultra Wide and Wide cameras) captures stunning photos with impressive detail and color accuracy. Night mode is a game-changer, allowing you to take beautifully illuminated shots even in low-light conditions. The ability to shoot 4K videos at 60fps with extended dynamic range further showcases the iPhone 11's imaging prowess.

Battery life has been another pleasant surprise. The iPhone 11 easily lasts me through a full day of heavy use, thanks to optimizations in hardware and software. Fast charging support means I can quickly top up when needed, which is incredibly convenient.

As for connectivity, having the iPhone 11 unlocked gives me the flexibility to switch between carriers without any hassle. It supports 4G LTE and the latest Wi-Fi standards, ensuring a stable and speedy connection wherever I go.

In terms of value, the iPhone 11 hits the sweet spot. It offers flagship-level performance and features without the premium price tag of the Pro models. The 64GB storage variant provides ample space for apps, photos, and videos, but you can always opt for higher capacities if needed.

In conclusion, the Apple iPhone 11 is a triumph of design, performance, and value. Whether you're an Apple aficionado or simply looking for a top-tier smartphone experience, this device delivers on all fronts. It's reliable, versatile, and beautifully crafted‚Äîa true testament to Apple's commitment to innovation. I wholeheartedly recommend the iPhone 11 to anyone seeking a dependable and feature-rich mobile companion."
"Apple iPhone 11, 64GB, White - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",Price not found,"When I initially received the phone, I checked the battery life and it was at 75%. There was a guarantee that the battery life would be at 80% so I reached out to the seller and they gave me several options: (1) To return the phone and get a full refund (2) Return the phone and exchange it for another phone (3) Go get the battery replaced at Best Buy or Apple Store and they would refund me the price.
I did end up getting the battery replaced and they refunded me the amount. They were super helpful and now I love my new phone!! :) Highly recommend because of the customer service i received!
Only thing I was slightly disappointed by was the color was slightly off, I was thinking more mint green instead of light teal. But that is not their fault, still love it!!"
"Apple iPhone 11, 64GB, White - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",Price not found,"Device works great, but beware: some Amazon renewed companies are excellent and some are garbage (1: Totally flawless and excellent 100% battery 2: got a renewed phone from a different renewed reseller where the phone reported 80% battery capacity... after two weeks it started draining super fast and the actual battery capacity was below 79% and dropping fast. 3: my third phone is great...i paid extra for premium but the screen was scratched but hidden by a screen protector.... why was I charged extra for premium?)"
"Apple iPhone 11, 64GB, White - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",Price not found,"I ordered this phone and received it in less than 4 days. I chose the ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù condition out of all the renewed options. It is a lot bigger than I expected, but then again, I didn‚Äôt check the dimensions before I ordered it. The phone was packaged in a single bubble wrap sleeve. The box it came in contained a wall adapter and charging cable. The phone is almost flawless except for some scuff marks around the charging port. There are also some scuff marks around the volume up button.

I like that the color of the iPhone is a muted lavender color rather than a vibrant purple. The phone came with a screen protector already installed. I didn‚Äôt realize this until hours later while I was setting up the phone. The battery health is set at 90%, and this was written on the bubble wrap sleeve.

The one thing I will say about this phone is that it does lack a working left speaker on the bottom. The other reviews all seem to mention the speaker problem, and I hate to agree. It‚Äôs not a dealbreaker, but I do wish the audio was up to par with the ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù condition the phone is supposed to be in.

By the way, this phone was sold to me by Electronic Deals. They seem to have a slightly above average reputation. I love the fact it has 128gb of storage. I upgraded from a refurbished iPhone 7, and I think I made a good decision! I like my new phone. I just need to get used to not having a home button lol."
"Apple iPhone 11, 64GB, White - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",Price not found,im going to keep this short because from experience ik how boring it can be to read long reviews but this is kind of a big buy/decision all i have to say is its a great phone ran into some minor issues nothing too bad and I don't think it was the company's fault i have had iphones most my life but i needed a temporary phone so i could save up to buy the newest one (its not relevant) but basically love it and its great and the issues were so minor no one would care and for the price go buy this beautiful phone i recommend color lavender gorgeous probably just like the person reading this lol but in conclusion great phone and i wouldnt hesitate to buy!

"Apple iPhone 11, 64GB, White - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",Price not found,"I have had such good fortune buying refurbished I-phones on Amazon.

Additionally now I can use certain mapping apps like OnX, and better versions of other apps as well. I like the video and pics programs better too. Such amazing technology all in a Pop tart sized package, I remember using 'party lines' when I was a kid in the early 60's so being able to do almost anything from a tiny 'walkie-talkie' like object is so cool to an old guy like me.

"Apple iPhone 11, 64GB, White - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",Price not found,"My husband is so rough on phones, we agreed not to spend a fortune on new ones even with tough cases. So he's had this one for around 2 months and it's doing great. It looked new and came with the cord. He is not a social media user. He just needs to be able to do text, call and send emails. The camera is a little better than his old phone. This was a good price and easy transition. I would purchase again from the seller."
"Apple iPhone 11, 64GB, White - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",Price not found,"The renewed iPhone 11 itself is in great condition. Battery health is at 91% and came with a screen protector. It‚Äôs been 2 weeks since setup completed and so far the phone is functioning as if it is new.

[Edited to add: After 1 month, the screen protector cracked twice. It has protected the main screen, but it is not that durable itself. The screen protector on my old phone went a year without cracking.]

My issues are with 1) shipping and 2) setup.
1) Shipping: Amazon said it would arrive on a specific date (3 days from time of order) and would require signature. Well, it was delivered a day early and left at the gate (that is always open), not at my house/door, and no one signed for it. The issue is that the gate is next to a public park, not secure at all and gets a fair amount of foot traffic. We had no idea they delivered it a day early and anyone could have walked by and taken it. Normally we‚Äôd be excited about packages arriving a day early, but this was a high $ item, left in a public area. Thankfully my husband left the house to run an errand and saw it by the gate. Unknown how long it was sitting there.

2) Setup took nearly 2 weeks and at least 15 times restating the setup process. It would get a little further in the process each time, then an issue would arise or would lock up and would require to start over again. Our rural town does not have high speed internet so went into town to use Starbucks WiFi & it was not enough to do what was needed. Ended up at a friend‚Äôs house but after 2 hrs I had to leave for appointments & errands. First issue, before I could do anything, the new iPhone requires an iOS update. It took 2 hrs to update the iOS on this new phone. Then it got stuck installing it, so had to install/uninstall it 4 separate times. Ended up going on a pre planned trip to see family in a big city and the internet at their house was like night and day. I was able to do the entire setup that weekend, but still had issues & had to call Apple for help. The whole set up process was soooo frustrating, infuriating, and disappointing that it took so long and was not as easy as they make it out to be. & Im good at troubleshooting electronic issues and researching resolutions. One thing I noticed is much of the troubleshooting advice online was outdated, even on the apple help website. Hope others have an easier time with setup."

"Apple iPhone 11, 64GB, White - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",Price not found,"My iPhone 6 died and was only iOS 10 so it was time to get a new phone. After much deliberation I decided to buy the Apple iPhone 11, US Version, 128GB, Green - Unlocked (Renewed) and couldn't be happier. It looks brand new, literally not one scuff mark, the battery was at 82% life but for $329.00 I got the phone, a charger (cord and block) and a clear protective case with iOS 16 installed. Way cheaper than buying new. I also liked that it's not a huge phone, 6.1 inches.

I was concerned as my old phone completely died so I wasn't sure how to get Apple ID and all on the new phone as I don't have a landline or other phone. I googled and learned to just select lost password at the Apple ID prompt, it allowed me to reset my Apple password by asking for my old phone's passcode to open. The sim card transfer was a piece of cake too for this non techy. I love all the new things the iPhone 11 can do, easier deleting some things, the camera is better and wide lens, more emojis for texting, etc. I haven't charged the phone at all since 6:00 AM this morning and have been playing with it, updating apps, installing, etc. and the battery is still going strong from this morning.

When you get the phone it walks you through set up which just took a few minutes. Meaning it let me enter a new password, set up my language, time zone, etc. I believe it asked about font size, etc as well, it was all easy setup - nothing really stymied me which I was grateful for.

To put it through its paces, I emailed, texted, called, received calls, took photos, surfed the net, downloaded form the App store, etc and thus far no issues and at this point I don't anticipate any.

Spending the additional $$ for the latest and supposedly greatest iPhone isn't necessary for me - and I don't have to deal with ""new"" issues the latest phones sometimes have. In summary, I would definitely buy unlocked and renewed again."

And I just noticed that I get 90 days to return if something goes wrong - pretty great policy - hopefully I won‚Äôt need it.

"Apple iPhone 11, 64GB, White - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",Price not found,"I sent PDI Mobile a message about the battery. Was this changed with an Apple battery? Were the case seals tested to be airtight after change out. Where does Amazon refurb come in if my phone was REFURBISHED by a third party? Something doesn't smell right but will publish any replies.

PDI responded that they use Apple replacements and case seals are checked! I feel like I won the Refurb Lottery! Speakers good and no messages on phone as to any part replacements or hardware errors."

"Apple iPhone 11, 64GB, White - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",Price not found,"Okay, so you probably see a lot of stuff about this phone being good or bad. 50/50. Well, the delivery stuff was kind of complicated on my end but that's a personal problem. The phone came in good condition, no scratches. But, it was a bit dirty on the back which I did clean off. Came with a charger and sim ejector. Phone works perfectly, had a small issue with iMessage & FT connection but overall was able to solve the problem quickly. 10/10 investment but it might charge a lot of tax, shipping was free.

This gets 4 stars cause of the dirtiness. My battery life was at an 85% and lasts pretty long regardless."
